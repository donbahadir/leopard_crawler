From field trips to housing, it’s all on IES Abroad’s website. **Get started**.\n#### Scholarships & Aid\nIES Abroad firmly believes that financial limitations should not prevent a qualified student from participating in an IES Abroad program.

For a thousand years, Cairo has flourished as one of the vital centers of the Arab world. \n###### **THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO**\n###### Founded in 1919 to offer a comprehensive American-style, liberal arts education to Egyptian students, The American University in Cairo (AUC) enrolls 7,000 students in its degree, Arabic language and study abroad programs. AUC students hail from over 60 different countries, but the majority of students are Egyptians.  AUC holds institutional accreditation from the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in the United States (MSCHE /\"Middle States\"). The University is also fully accredited by ABET and AACSB. Credits earned at AUC are transferable to any U.S. college or university, provided that course material is approved on an individual basis by the home institution.\n###### **AUC CAMPUS**\n###### In 2008, the University campus moved from its location in central downtown Cairo to the **suburb of New Cairo, a development comprising 46,000 acres of land and with a projected population of 2.5 million people. The new 260-acre complex weaves Egyptian urban and architectural traditions into a modern campus that places a distinct emphasis on environmental sustainability.**\n###### **The campus offers state-of-the-art resources to students and faculty from Egypt and around the world and is accessible to persons with disabilities. Campus facilities include libraries boasting** the largest English-language research collection in Egypt, a travel office, bank, fully-staffed medical clinic, counseling center, student dormitories, a state-of-the-art athletic complex, and a variety of food services. Take a virtual tour of the campushere.\n###### A University shuttle system provides convenient access to downtown Cairo, from which students can explore a wealth of cultural opportunities. The Cairo Museum--the world's richest repository of pharaonic antiquities--is only a short walk from the old campus center, while the pyramids of Giza, the tombs of Saqqara, and the myriad mosques of medieval Cairo are all within an hour's ride.\n###### **PROGRAM OPTIONS** **General Study Abroad** --Students choose classes from among more than 30 undergraduate programs. The language of instruction is English, but Arabic language courses are offered as well. For study abroad students wishing to study Arabic alongside general courses from other disciplines, AUC offers a wide range of non-intensive classes in Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Colloquial Arabic.\n###### **Arabic Language Institute--** In its Arabic Language Institute (ALI) AUC maintains what is probably the largest corps of full-time, professional Arabic language teachers in the world, and its many Arabic programs have earned international renown for their quality and competence. The ALI Intensive Arabic Program is ideal for students wishing to maximize their progress in Arabic language study by focusing exclusively on Arabic for the period of their study abroad. Students in this program take a full course load of intensive classes in Arabic language and Egyptian culture. \n###### Both programs are offered during the 6-week summer session and the two full semesters (fall and spring.) The general Study Abroad program is also available during the 3-week winter session. Students attending the summer and winter programs take reduced course loads to correspond with the shorter periods of instruction. \n###### **COURSE LOAD**\n###### The full course load at AUC is four or five classes (12-15 credits) per semester. The standard summer session load is 2 classes (6 credits); the winter session, one class (3 credits.) Study Abroad students must maintain full-time status in order to qualify for a student visa.\n###### **Fields of Study:**\n###### Accounting \n###### Actuarial Science\n###### African Studies\n###### American Studies\n###### Architectural Engineering\n###### Anthropology \n###### Applied Probability and Statistics\n###### Arab and Islamic Civilizations\n###### Arabic Studies\n###### Archaeological Chemistry\n###### Architectural Design\n###### Art\n###### Biology\n###### Business Administration\n###### Chemistry\n###### Classical/Medieval Islamic History\n| \n###### Comparative Religion\n###### Computer Engineering\n###### Computer Science\n###### Construction Engineering\n###### Coptic Studies\n###### Development Studies\n###### Economics\n###### Egyptology\n###### Electronics Engineering\n###### English and Comparative Literature\n###### Environmental Science\n###### Film\n###### Gender and Women's Studies\n###### History\n###### Information Systems\n###### International Relations\n###### Islamic Art and Architecture\n| \n###### Islamic Studies\n###### Journalism and Mass Communication\n###### Linguistics\n###### Mathematics\n###### Mechanical Engineering\n###### Middle East Studies\n###### Music\n###### Petroleum and Energy Engineering\n###### Philosophy\n###### Physics\n###### Political Economy\n###### Political Science\n###### Psychology\n###### Rhetoric and Writing\n###### Sociology\n###### Theater  \n---|---|---  \n###### **STUDENT LIFE**\n###### International students at AUC are encouraged to get involved in the campus and city communities by exploring the numerous cultural, academic, and community service clubs available, or by participating in one of several student-organized conferences. School-sponsored events include lectures and panel discussions on current religious, political and cultural debates; outings to the pyramids; a weekend trip to Alexandria; horseback riding in the desert; and felucca rides on the Nile. AUC offers a multitude of social, athletic, travel and cultural opportunities throughout the semester. Study abroad students have successfully represented AUC in the annual Egyptian National University Sports Competition in gymnastics, rowing, basketball and volleyball. Students often complete the training necessary to become certified scuba divers while enjoying the coral reefs of the Red Sea. Others become involved in musical theater and dance events on campus and in the community. Almost all international students will travel on their own or with student-organized groups to tourist sites in Egypt and to other countries in the region. \n###### **CAMPUS HOUSING**\n###### The on-campus residence facility has twelve residential units called cottages- 7 for women and 5 for men. Each cottage has a ground (garden) level plus 2 floors with a sum total of nine double rooms, one single room and five apartments. Each apartment has four single rooms and a common living space; there are two toilets, a sink, common lounge and study area. As for the rooms outside the apartment setup, for every three double rooms, there are two showers, two baths and two sinks. Each cottage has a courtyard and a roof terrace. The men's section and the women's section each have study areas. There is a laundry room with washers and dryers and a storage trunk in both the women's and men's cottage areas.\n###### Students living on campus can use the AUC shuttle system to travel between campus and the city center at nights and on weekends as they wish.\n######  **ACADEMIC CALENDAR**\n###### Fall: September- December Winter: January (3 weeks) Spring: Late January- Late May Summer: June-July (6 weeks)\n###### For specific program dates, including those for orientations, University holidays, and final examinations, please view our academic calendar. \n###### **HEALTH INSURANCE**\n###### AUC also requires all international students on its campus to enroll in a comprehensive Egyptian private health insurance program. \n###### **FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIPS**\n###### Most students are able to apply aid from their home institution to the cost of study abroad. One-time consortium agreements can be arranged to facilitate this transfer of aid if no standard billing agreement is in place.\nThis program occurs in a country that is rated as a Level 3 (reconsider travel) or Level 4 (do not travel) Department of State Travel Advisory and/or has been designated as a country with greater than normal risks by regional experts (On Call International, experts in the Lafayette College community, etc.).

Spending a semester abroad comes with a wide range of benefits, such as making new friends, experiencing different cultures, cultivating a sense of independence, and learning how to multitask many elements of life. Greek culture is like no other, and made my study abroad experience feel very unique compared to what it would've been like to study in another European city. Ultimately, studying abroad at CYA is an experience I would do again 100 times if I had the chance, as it has allowed me to grow so much as a person and has given me people and memories I will never forget.” Mia Iannios, George Washington University, Fall 2023  CYA also offers Summer, Winter, and Post-Baccalaureate programs.

You will be a visiting student at a specific college, and will focus your studies on your major and minor subjects. Most tutorials will be one-on-one or small group meetings between students and tutors, though some science subjects have lectures as well. For specific information about each of our University of Oxford programs, please see the specific college or hall listing within your school’s study abroad student portal:\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Hertford College\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Lady Margaret Hall\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Mansfield College\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Regent’s Park College\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Anne’s College\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Anne’s College - Premedical Program\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Catherine’s College\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Edmund College\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Peter’s College (Summer)\n  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Worcester College\n\n**Academics**\n  * Study at one of the world’s most prestigious universities\n  * Classic tutorial-based courses allow you to delve deeply into your subject area. The one-on-one teaching format means that your syllabus is flexible based on your interests.\n  * Join a non-auditioning and very welcoming student choir that performs regular performances and weekly lunch time concerts.\n  * Participate in a diverse range of social activities, including dances, jazz and cocktails, quizzes, movie nights and more.\n  * Facilities for most major sports in or near the college, including a boathouse for student use.\n  * Fall students can arrive early for the Early Start/September Seminar, which awards an additional 4 U.S. semester credit hours.

The tutorial is typically a one-hour meeting between one or two students and the tutor. Tutorials usually meet once a week or every other week, and at the center of the tutorial is an essay on a topic the tutor previously assigned. The tutor will lead a discussion about the essay topic in an effort to provide new insights. At the end of the tutorial, the tutor will assign a new topic and may offer recommended reading. Tutorials are individually arranged, taking into account the subject to be studied and the tutor's area of expertise. They are similar to independent study courses, but Oxford students bear even more responsibility for conducting independent research and maintaining good academic progress. The University of Oxford organizes weekly lectures on myriad academic subjects, and all students at the University, regardless of college, are welcome to attend. Lectures are not usually mandatory except for some science subjects, but tutors often recommend them as good supplements to tutorials and research. **About Oxford** Oxford is a bustling, modern city anchored by an air of academic tradition, with a diverse population and an urban edge. Oxford offers incredible architecture, from medieval to modern, cultural events, museums, concert halls, river sports in addition to pubs, restaurants, and nightlife.  **Afford Your Journey** Grants, financial aid, credit card payments and more are available. IFSA scholarships are primarily need-based and factor in any additional cost your study abroad program might have over home school tuition. The awards are $500 for summer programs, $1,500 for semester programs, and $2,500 for full year programs. These scholarships may apply to any IFSA program, with the exception of our custom programs. **Take the Next Step!**\n  * Visit our website for more information about the individual University of Oxford program, including courses, housing arrangements, and co-curricular activities.\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, Hertford College\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, Lady Margaret Hall\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, Mansfield College\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, Regent’s Park College\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Anne’s College\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Anne’s College - Premedical Program\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Catherine’s College\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Edmund College\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Peter’s College (Summer)\n    * IFSA - University of Oxford, Worcester College\n  * Contact your IFSA Program Advisor at 800.858.0229 orstudyabroad@ifsa-butler.org\n  * **Apply to an IFSA program now! **\n\n\n**Contact Us** 6201 Corporate Drive Suite 200 Indianapolis, IN 46278 800.858.0229 studyabroad@ifsa-butler.org IFSA-Butler.org\nDates / Deadlines:\nDates / Deadlines: Term |  Year |  App Deadline |  Decision Date |  Start Date |  End Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSpring |  2026  |  10/01/2025 **  |  Rolling Admission  |  TBA |  TBA  \n** Indicates rolling admission application process.

ANDREWS PARTNERSHIP** St Andrews, Scotland **WHY STUDY IN CITY?** St. Andrews is the quintessential university town and also full of history dating back to the sixth century.

Students who have a handicap that meets the standards of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club can play on the Old Course of St. Andrews for a surprisingly reasonable fee. **ABOUT THE PROGRAM** With a history that began in 1413, it’s no wonder Scotland’s oldest university is big on traditions, like donning red academic gowns and plunging into the North Sea before exams in May. With 8,000 students, St Andrews is smaller than many UK universities, allowing for both individual attention and academics that rival Oxford and Cambridge, in everything from international relations to computer and environmental science. Themes—like Scotland, Sustainability, Travel and Exploration, Science for Arts Majors, Unique to St Andrews and Community—help visiting students find interesting classes. Plus, your Advisor of Studies will explain the academic system and help you choose your modules (classes). The school has its own marine lab (check out aquatic ecology, biology and marine science classes—including one that explores the social interactions of whales and dolphins). When it’s time for a break, meet friends on Market Street or hang out on one of the town’s three gorgeous beaches. To see more of Scotland and the UK, hop a bus to Dundee (13 miles away), where it’s an easy journey to Edinburgh or Glasgow, and four to six hours to London by train. You can’t leave Scotland without exploring more of its raw natural beauty. Your IFSA Highland excursion makes it easy, with no extra fees. Explore icons like the Three Sisters peaks, Loch Ness, and Dunnottar Castle, as you share an insider’s view of the historical events that shaped this country’s history and culture.

Learn about human rights, social movements, and the development of individual liberties in a multicultural context. \nWHY STUDY MULTICULTURALISM IN MOROCCO? The challenges and complexities of human rights, social justice, and cultural transformations in today’s Morocco are an outgrowth of the 2011 Arab Spring that took hold throughout North Africa. These uprisings against oppression and marginalization, and the cultural shifts that followed, have expanded the demands and repertoires of current struggles in Morocco. Modern movements have grown in visibility as the state, Islamists, and activists seek to define human rights and social justice on their own terms. This program explores the present-day characteristics of the struggles for human rights and social justice within regional, national, and international contexts. We examine the resulting cultural transformations through a range of lenses including gender, individual liberties, globalization, and socioeconomic and political changes. Excursions to the north and south of the country offer a view of the systems of power and privilege that have produced inequality and unjust environmental conditions, as well as the movements and organizations that have emerged in response. We engage with social economies that cross class and gender, including women-owned businesses producing local products and re-connecting their communities to the land and the environment, and local NGOs that are working collectively to create change.

Across four continents, compare health systems and strategies, community well-being, and multiple factors affecting human health in different contexts on both local and global scales. Journey from mega-cities to rural villages to take a holistic, interdisciplinary look at how communities around the world define what it is to achieve and maintain health. With this incredible scope of experiences, you will learn to critically analyze some of the most pressing health issues of this global moment, such as social inequities, the pandemic, climate change, and the economic drivers of healthcare. You will explore individual and population health through site visits and research practice with an array of health practitioners, government officials, and activists; and you will witness how positioning health as a human right impacts policy and health outcomes at all levels. Finally, explore the challenges all citizens face amid mounting obstacles to healthcare access, while strengthening your ability to understand, interpret, and compare the sociocultural, ecological, economic, political, and biological factors that shape and predict human health.\n**Explore a Day in the Life of an IHP student!**\n_Photos on this page may depict program sites from previous semesters.

Using the same portable next generation sequencing platform employed on the International Space Station and in both the Arctic and Antarctic wilderness, students enrolled in SEA’s Marine Biodiversity & Conservation Program learn how to use modern molecular tools to ask and answer ecological and conservation questions as they sail from New Zealand to Tahiti. Traversing a range of bioregions, including temperate, blue water, and tropical, students will collect zooplankton specimens from the mesopelagic (the Ocean Twilight Zone), and conduct group research projects addressing population genomics and biodiversity. Students will examine how these ecosystems are responding to climate change, and gain an understanding of how such research informs conservation policy. The MBC program along this cruise track is planned as a long-term and much needed data set that can help shape conservation in the Pacific. The program ends in Tahiti with a two-week second shore component and student-led symposium with local stakeholders, scientists, and conservationists. The Marine Biodiversity & Conservation program is geared toward students interested in in ocean science as a career, as well as those interested in marine ecology and conservation, molecular biology, or environmental marine policy.\nDates / Deadlines:\nDates / Deadlines: Term |  Year |  App Deadline |  Decision Date |  Start Date |  End Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSpring |  2026  |  10/01/2025 **  |  Rolling Admission  |  TBA |  TBA  \n** Indicates rolling admission application process.

Located in the quaint town of Heidelberg with its traditional romantic flair it is committed to the motto Future since 1386. The relationship between American Junior Year and Ruperto Carola dates back to 1958, making us one of the oldest American study abroad programs in Germany and the oldest exchange program of its kind. Every year, several Universität Heidelberg students spend time at the Heidelberg University home campus in Tiffin, Ohio as exchange students. In addition, Tiffin hosts a Teaching Assistant, who teaches in the Modern Languages Department.\n## Highlights of the Program\n  * Study at Germany's oldest university.\n  * Live with German students.\n  * Opportunities to be involved in community activities and meet regularly with a language partner.\n  * Study and relax at the AJY study center in the heart of the historic Altstadt on University Square.\n  * Discover Germany and explore Europe with Rail Passes and Culture Coupons sponsored by the program.\n  * Understand why one of the most popular German folk songs is entitled \"Ich hab' mein Herz in Heidelberg verloren\".\n\n\n### Academics\nStudents arrive in Heidelberg six weeks before the actual start of the university semester, allowing them time for a preliminary course designed to prepare students for the University Language Proficiency Exam (DSH). Nearly all undergraduate courses at Universität Heidelberg are taught in German, so the DSH exam plays a major role in determining which courses are suited for you. Once students have taken the DSH exam, they will have a week break. Aside from the mandatory preliminary course, students enroll in four additional courses, or three courses and an academic internship. Most courses earn three U.S. credits. Occasionally, a course might have a tutorial or a lab earning an additional credit. Your total number of credits as a full year student will be 30-32 credits. Read more about academic options.\n### Program & Semester Dates\nUniversität Heidelberg, like all German universities runs on a semester system with two semesters per year, Wintersemester (October - February) and Sommersemester (April - July). In order to accommodate American students from both, semester and term-based schools, AJY offers two fall semester options. Other options include a full academic year, spring semester or our Summer Program. No matter which option students choose, they will earn between 15-16 academic credits per semester. Read more about academic options.\n### Student Life\nThe sooner you are involved in activities in the local community, the more exciting and rewarding your time in Heidelberg is. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination. All students receive a five-day German Rail Pass for either fall or spring break. AJY student rooms are located in university dormitories throughout the city or in private dormitories for students only. Meals can be eaten in the cafeterias near the AJY Study Center, or you may choose to eat at one of the many restaurants in Old Town around University Square. Read more about Student Life.\n### Fees & Expenses\nStudying abroad is an investment in your future. The program fee and estimated costs are available to help you plan for your experience.\n### Apply Now\nInterested in applying for AJY?

Eight graceful bridges link the charming hills of Buda on the river's west bank to cosmopolitan Pest on the east. The construction of the Royal Palace on Buda's Castle Hill was begun over 700 years ago. Actually, the history of this district dates even earlier; a thousand years before the Hungarian kings, Roman warriors maintained a military settlement there to guard the \"limes\" of the Empire. Buda and Pest were united in 1872 and the union grew into the friendly metropolis we see now in modern Budapest with its elegant boulevards, coffeehouses, and concert halls. \n### Hungary\nHungary is a small country, about the size of Indiana. Its population is 10 million. Located in Central Europe, it is bordered by Slovakia on the north, Ukraine and Romania on the east, Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia to the south, and Austria on the west. Hungary had a turbulent past. The country was invaded and was under foreign domination for much of the second half of its 1100-year history. Defying numerous conquerors, Hungary has maintained a distinct language and culture. **Academics**\n  * Classes are taught in English\n  * Classes meet two hours per day, four days a week\n  * Classes are small with a focus on problem-solving, student creativity, and group learning.\n\n\n### **Course Offerings**\nFrom our usual course selection, we offer four full courses plus the research option(s) in the summer.

Nowadays, the two capital cities - strikingly different from one another - continue to be the preeminent cultural and political capitals of their respective countries. Berlin, forced by the destruction of World War II to rebuild itself in two different ways and under two radically different political systems, is awash with mid-century, international style structures on the west and immense, concrete apartment structures in the east; Berlin is trendy and vibrant, embracing grit and informality despite its other role as the political heart of the Eurozone's most powerful member. Vienna, on the other hand, wows at first glimpse with regal Pracht, the self-evident former capital of a large, European empire.

Historically, colonial and apartheid racial discrimination policies categorized people according to race, including Bantu (Black), Coloured (those who were not categorized as Bantu or white) and the minority white. Law created a racial hierarchy with white people at the top of the pyramid, and diminishing rights, access and “human-ness” moving down the hierarchy, which placed Coloured people as a buffer between those categorized as white and black. The cleavages of this legacy remain evident in the lived realities of South Africans.\nStarting from your base in Cape Town, you’ll learn how race relations continue to be shaped by a range of contested histories, politics, resistance, activism, and the deployment of rights-based rhetoric. Journey to key sites such as the Steve Biko Centre, where you will study the Black Consciousness Movement, and Robben Island, the prison that held the late South African President Nelson Mandela. You will experience South Africa through the eyes of diverse homestay families in city and rural locations.\nPlease visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program courses (including syllabi), educational excursions, and housing.\nMONEY MATTERS\nSIT is an all-inclusively priced study abroad program – including academics costs, excursions, accommodations and meals, airport transfers, and health insurance.

The curriculum provides an intensive field and laboratory-based introduction to ecosystem science and the biogeochemistry of coastal forests, freshwater ponds and estuaries. The curriculum leads students to develop research questions of their own. Equipped with new knowledge and techniques learned in the first weeks of the semester, they pursue independent research during the last six weeks of the program. SESÂ students report their findings at a final symposium that is open to the entire Woods Hole scientific community, a world center for marine and environmental sciences. **THE CORE COURSES** The SES program emphasizes learning by doing -- students spend over 20 hours each week in the lab and field investigating forests, ponds and estuaries on Cape Cod. Virtually all ecosystems have been impacted by human activity, and so this is also a curriculum about how human-caused changes in the environment are affecting the globe. Core course lecturescover both**aquatic** and**terrestrial ecosystems** from the point of view of biogeochemistry and important ecological processes. Course research takes place in local ecosystems -- ponds and estuaries within the Waquoit Bay watershed adjacent to Vineyard Sound, West Falmouth Harbor on Buzzards Bay, and the town forest at the municipal sewage treatment plant. **ELECTIVES** In addition to the Core Courses, SES students take one elective which meets twice a week. The elective is intended to deepen understanding in a specific sub-discipline of ecosystems science. Choose from: \n  * Aquatic Chemistry,\n  * Ecosystems Dynamics,\n  * Global Ecology,\n  * Human-dominated Ecosystems,\n  * Mathematical Modeling,\n  * Microbial Methods\n\n**PROJECTS** The structured laboratory experiences and techniques of the core courses and electives set the stage for the most rewarding part of the SES program, the projects. During the last five weeks of the course, students will be able to devote full time to a project of their choosing. **DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST SEMINAR SERIES** A number of distinguished scientists are invited to give lectures and meet with SES students each year. It is an opportunity for students to hear from some of the country's top practitioners and to find out about their research and current concerns. During the visit of each of these scientists, the SES students are able to question them closely about everything from basic science to environmental problems to the availability of graduate programs. **SCIENCE WRITING SEMINAR** SES students all take part in a seminar that introduces the art of science writing. This is taught by our writer-in-residence and several professional science journalists with the goal of illustrating how the results of scientific investigations can be transmitted to the larger reading audience in ways that catch their interest and educate. Students will write a profile of one of the distinguished scientists based on an interview. With this and other programs at the Marine Biological Laboratory, we hope to begin training a new generation of writers conversant in science who can communicate about critical environmental issues with the public. **Prerequisites** Because of the diversity of curricula at the schools participating in the Environmental Science Consortium, we are providing a description of the knowledge we hope students will have, rather than specific course requirements. We have grouped these under three categories: Biological Science, Chemistry and Mathematics. Students who are deficient in a given area may still qualify for entrance in the program at the discretion of the on-campus advisor and selection committee. \nDates / Deadlines:\nThere are currently no active application cycles for this program. \n_Lafayette Engineering, interim, and summer programs have unique enrollment processes.

Home to many young professionals and students, there are plenty of new friends to make and an active nightlife waiting for you in Nantes. Once the capital of Brittany, Nantes has a rich history, which you can see firsthand by visiting the Cathédrale St-Pierre et St-Paul and the Château des Ducs de Bretagne. It's also easy to walk around and explore the city by foot.\nThe IES Abroad Nantes Program has two important goals: to improve your written and verbal proficiency in French through language and area studies courses and teaching internships, and to introduce you to contemporary France and its role in the European Union. Founded in 1965, the program is small enough to welcome you into the community, yet large enough to allow for a variety of academic and extracurricular activities. We offer you the opportunity to integrate fully into French society and function completely in French, due to the program's focus on full immersion and the fact that there are few Anglophones in Nantes.\nThis program enjoys a close relationship with the Université de Nantes. You have access to the school's libraries, computer labs, cafeterias, and sports facilities, and are welcome to join student clubs and other social and sports organizations. You also have many opportunities for enrolling in university courses. IES Abroad courses are taught in French by native French faculty, many of whom are professors at the Université de Nantes. You select from IES Abroad language and area studies courses, and can add a teaching internship and university courses to complete your schedule.\nVisit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.\n#### Why Nantes?\nImagine yourself stopping by the 15th century Château des Ducs, exploring fine arts museums, enjoying a crêpe in a quaint café, and walking along the Loire River in this quintessential French town. It's the sixth largest city in France, but quaint enough to feel at home. Did we mention the food is divine? Discover the F _rench joie de vivre_ when you study abroad in Nantes.\n#### Student Life\nWe strive to make sure you feel safe, cared for, and at home while you’re away from home.

It's here that you will get hands-on experience studying topics such as Biology, Ecology, Environmental Studies, Marine Ecology, and Sociology.\nThis direct enrollment program is organized through the Galápagos Academic Institute for the Arts and Sciences (GAIAS), a remote campus of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) located on the island of San Cristobal. Before you head to the Galápagos, the program will begin with a month in Quito, where you participate in an orientation, classes at USFQ, and field study excursions. The remaining months are spent on San Cristobal in the Galápagos Islands, although additional field study excursions allow you to spend time in other locations, as determined by your chosen track: Evolution, Ecology and Conservation; Marine Ecology; or People, Politics, and the Environment.\nThe Galápagos Islands and Quito will be your classroom. Witness the famous land iguanas and giant tortoises as you study the evolution of these unique species. Visit indigenous and traditional Andean communities to better understand the relationship between humans and their environment.

Following field-camp, students transition to a campus semester at the University of Canterbury located in Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island. While at the University of Canterbury, students enroll in four courses, one of which is a research methods course based upon data collected in field camp. **Field Camp Spring Semester: January 9th – February 13th, 2017 Field Camp Fall Semester: June 7th – July 15th, 2017** For 5.5 weeks, students will travel throughout the North and South Islands, deciphering the geologic evolution of New Zealand from a series of linked field modules. Our goal is to provide students with a skill base of field-focused techniques that will enable them to understand the fundamental causes and timescales of geologic processes. Field work is complemented by map preparation and exercises in the evenings, as well as lectures that highlight a wide variety of our staff’s field and laboratory-based studies. **2017 field modules (modules subject to change):**\n  * **Field Module 1: Introduction to Geologic Field Mapping in Castle Hills Basin.** The first component of field camp is an introduction to field mapping in the Castle Hill Basin, located in the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps, inland Canterbury. Students will learn basic field skills including compass work and navigation, triangulating for location, field notetaking and sketching, outcrop descriptions, introduction to geomorphological observations, and producing a small geologic map.\n  * **Field Module 2: Detailed stratigraphic and structural mapping in an uplifted and deformed succession of Oligocene marine strata (Castle Hill basin).** The second module examines the stratigraphy and structural geology of Castle Hill basin, located in the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps, inland Canterbury. This part of the course will focus on advanced field mapping skills, including the compilation of a detailed stratigraphic column, mapping geological contacts and structures, geomorphic features, and preparing geological cross sections. The structural mapping concentrates on the complex folding best expressed by a middle Tertiary limestone unit, and we will be developing a structure contour map on this unit. This will develop an understanding of both the structural and geomorphic evolution of the basin, and subsequent uplift, deformation and glaciations.\n  * **Field Module 3: Gondwanaland to New Zealand: reconstructing the geologic architecture of the South Island.** Field module 3 integrates different types of geologic data to interpret a geologic history of the Buller District of the West Coast region, South Island. This part of the field programme is based in Westport. This model focuses on the examination of a metamorphic core complex, its less deformed cover and contemporaneous basin deposits reflecting the Cretaceous Gondwana breakup and related extension. Additionally, we will study the tectonic controls on the formation and evolution of the Cretaceous-Tertiary basins of the region, and how this has been subsequently folded and faulted. The field programme provides further field training utilizing and developing basic field mapping skills such as the observation, recording and interpretation of folded bedding-cleavage relationships, and furthers structural relationships at varying scales.\n  * **Field Module 4: Volcanoes: Eruption Styles, Volcano Monitoring and Hazards.** Large stratovolcanoes are what come to mind when one typically imagines a volcano. In this module, students will learn how these types of volcanoes are constructed over time, the scale of the different eruption types and their resulting volcanic deposits, the frequency of eruptions, and what happens to these volcanoes when they are not erupting. In addition, students will learn about the associated hazards of the these volcanoes and put their newfound mapping skills and volcanic knowledge to the test in a an eruption simulation exercise.\n  * **Field Module 5: Independent Research Projects.** During field module 5, students will apply the skills acquired during the first four weeks of field camp to group mapping projects of previously unmapped terrain on Banks Peninsula. This is the capstone field camp experience that leads into the initiation of your semester research project during this last field module. Research projects in 2017 could involve volcanology, igneous petrology, geomorphology, paleoclimatology, digital mapping (GIS and 3-D visualisation), geo-archaeology, geologic hazards, engineering geology, and geo-education.\n\n**Spring Campus Semester: February 17th – June 24th, 2017 Fall Campus Semester: July 15th – November 13th, 2016** The field camp experience will transition into a semester at the University of Canterbury. Students will enroll in 4 semester courses (2 Geology courses including a required research methods course, and 2 course of your choosing from the University of Canterbury course catalogue). The research methods course allows the students to conduct a research project based upon data collected during field camp. In addition, students will learn to compile and prepare a professional map and geologic history based on field module 1 \n### **What will I study?**\n**Programme Details:** **Credits/Units:** Five course credits transcripted by the Lafayette College.\n  1.

Based at an SLU-owned and operated campus in a verdant, peaceful, and safe suburb of Nairobi, the Kenya program is rooted in this deep tradition and is committed to providing students with a unique study abroad experience. SLU believes the best way to learn about Kenya is through cultural immersion and experiential learning. As a result, students supplement formal coursework and language study in Kenya's bustling capital city with rural and urban homestays, three additional field components, and a month-long independent study where students examine East Africa's diverse society. As a program that is open to students of all academic interests, SLU welcomes applications from students at other institutions. You can also learn more about the student experience by visiting the Kenya program's Facebook page & Kenya program's blog. Take a virtual tour of the compound and meet the staff or explore a video preview made by KSP alumnus and professional videographer Beau Gaughran '15. \n  * Based in Nairobi\n  * Fall or spring semester\n  * Enrollment can accommodate up 28 - 30 students (including non-SLU students)\n  * Pre-requisites: 2.8 GPA; one African Studies course\n  * Must take Swahili while in Kenya\n  * Live within program housing and with homestay families\n  * State Department Travel Warning and St. Lawrence Policies for Studying Safely in Kenya\n\nIf you are NOT a St. Lawrence student and are interested in applying, please contact ciis@stlawu.edu to inquire about non-SLU deadlines and scholarship opportunities. \n### Location\nLying on the Equator, Kenya is home to a diverse population of over 40 million. The cosmopolitan capital city of Nairobi, rising from the plateau of south-central Kenya, is the home base of our program. A city with over three million residents, Nairobi is East Africa's regional center for trade and is one of three cities in the world to host a regional headquarters of the United Nations. Based in this vibrant and diverse city, students will gain familiarity with the urban environment while also visiting many of the rural areas, where approximately 75 percent of the country's population resides. The program's headquarters are located in Karen, a leafy suburb of Nairobi, where St. Lawrence operated a 5 1/2 acre gated campus. Students use the campus as a home base for the semester, but only spend about 8 weeks living here. The two faculty directors, as well as program staff, also live on campus. Students spend time during the semester traveling throughout Kenya and East Africa on various course components explained in detail below. \n### Academics\nThe Kenya Semester Program is an interdisciplinary academic program that uses a combination of learning models -- classroom, field-based and experiential -- and emphasizes cultural immersion throughout the semester. Students take two required courses. In addition, students select two elective courses so they can focus on their own field of interest or specialization. The program serves majors from a number of different disciplines. Whether matriculated at St. Lawrence or elsewhere, all students must take four courses to earn full-semester credit. For dual-listed courses, students must indicate while registering in Kenya for which department they want the course listed. Therefore, students must confer with their advisors and department chairpersons well in advance of studying in Kenya to plan their program and avoid problems. \n### Housing\nThe program's headquarters are located in Karen, a suburb of Nairobi, where St. Lawrence University operates a five-acre gated campus. Students use the campus as a home base for the semester but only spend about eight weeks living here. The three program directors, as well as several program staff, also live on campus. Students spend time during the semester traveling throughout Kenya and East Africa on various course components. Students spend the various course components living with homestay families, in hotels, camping for one field component, and in guesthouses or apartments for their independent study. \nDates / Deadlines:\nDates / Deadlines: Term |  Year |  App Deadline |  Decision Date |  Start Date |  End Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSpring |  2026  |  10/01/2025 **  |  Rolling Admission  |  TBA |  TBA  \n** Indicates rolling admission application process.

You can also enhance your experience by taking courses in Art History, History, Humanities, Psychology, and so much more. Your studies will also take you throughout Vienna and outside the city, with a program-related trip where you’ll visit companies like Red Bull in Salzburg, and BMW in Munich, as well as organizations in and around Vienna.

This interdisciplinary class tackles Rome’s art, history, archaeology, topography, social make-up, and much more. The Professor-in-Charge heads up the course, and all Centro faculty lend their expertise to this joint endeavor.\nOver the course of a typical week, Centristi dedicate two half-days and one full day to The Ancient City. Almost all class meetings unfold on archaeological sites, in museums, and amid standing remains. Daylong excursions to Rome’s neighboring cities and sites round out the picture of Rome’s growth from a clutch of huts on a hill to the head of a Mediterranean-spanning empire. Additionally, throughout the term, the Centro hits the road for longer excursions: to the Bay of Naples and elsewhere throughout Roman lands, such as Sicily, stunning sites in Northern Italy, colonial cities in Southern France or other spots as chosen by the faculty. Thanks to these trips, The Ancient City touches on Etruscan, Greek, Roman, and native Italian (and even Gallic) populations, their interactions, and mutual influence. While the course focuses on Rome, a rich picture of the city’s broader context emerges as The Ancient City unfolds. What can you expect from The Ancient City? Stand where Cicero delivered speeches in the Forum Romanum. Descend into subterranean shrines to the mystery cult of Mithras. Learn about the self-identities of former enslaved peoples along the Via Appia. Contrast the grand reception rooms of sprawling villas with the cramped kitchens and narrow hallways of urban apartments at Pompeii, Ostia, and Herculaneum.\nDates / Deadlines:\nDates / Deadlines: Term |  Year |  App Deadline |  Decision Date |  Start Date |  End Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSpring |  2026  |  10/01/2025 **  |  Rolling Admission  |  TBA |  TBA  \n** Indicates rolling admission application process.

We must also consider the possibilities found within social and political institutions, economic systems, cultural practices, and the creative forces of art, literature, and design. The humanities and social sciences contribute to knowledge of how our changing climate impacts human lives and societies, and they play a vital role in building strategies for global climate resilience and adaptation. During the shore component, students will develop a semester-long research project, review essential climate humanities literature, and design a plan for original field research. Climate & Society will discuss a range of climate related issues including human migration and displacement, coastal and urban resilience, environmental justice, energy alternatives, and sustainable design. The sailing component begins in Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand, where students will examine climate change issues and local solutions with marine scientists and community leaders. Students will learn about coastal erosion mitigation strategies in Aotearoa New Zealand and explore the effects of climate change on agricultural production and foodways there. Through daily oceanographic surveys, “classroom” discussions, and navigational training while at sea, students participating in Climate & Society will gain a unique and valuable perspective of how climate change links oceanic and terrestrial systems. The Climate & Society cruise track returns to Auckland with a final onboard symposium featuring student presentations of field research and storytelling projects.\nDates / Deadlines:\nDates / Deadlines: Term |  Year |  App Deadline |  Decision Date |  Start Date |  End Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSpring |  2026  |  10/01/2025 **  |  Rolling Admission  |  TBA |  TBA  \n** Indicates rolling admission application process.

Increasingly, residents of vulnerable coastal communities are on the front lines in the struggle against rising seas and strengthening storm cycles. That struggle also raises complex issues of climate justice and public health, everywhere from large urban areas to small rural towns and villages. Climate Change and Coastal Resilience, a mid-level undergraduate program examines the ways climate change is affecting coastal communities and explores strategies for building coastal resilience. Beginning with a shore program in Woods Hole, students gain a theoretical understanding of climate change impacts on societies, ecosystems, and economies. The academic curriculum includes lectures from leading climate scientists and policy experts and field trips to local research institutions in surrounding area. Students engage in discussions on topics such as rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and ocean acidification. Following the shore program, students embark on a sailing voyage from Auckland to Christchurch, visiting several coastal towns and cities along the way. During their time at sea, students gain hands-on research experience through the deployment of oceanographic research equipment. At port stops, students will connect with local experts and community members to better understand the ways in which climate change is impacting the region. \nDates / Deadlines:\nDates / Deadlines: Term |  Year |  App Deadline |  Decision Date |  Start Date |  End Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSpring |  2026  |  10/01/2025 **  |  Rolling Admission  |  TBA |  TBA  \n** Indicates rolling admission application process.

Historically, coral reefs and their interconnected ecosystems have safeguarded islands, supported growing populations with food, and contributed to tourism and economic growth. However, numerous local and global threats, such as resource extraction, declining water quality, rising temperatures, and reduced pH levels, endanger the Caribbean region, making it one of the most impacted areas worldwide. An investigative science and policy program examining the impacts of human actions on Caribbean coral reef ecosystems, the importance of coral reefs to island communities, and the full range of reef management strategies. Beginning with six weeks in Woods Hole, students develop background knowledge to understand history, science, and policy strategies involved in managing coral reefs. In the eight weeks of the remote shore component, students will engage in coral research in seaside scientific field stations and local communities as they develop and refine reef survey techniques and collect initial observations for comparative reef projects. Students will learn from and assist Caribbean Island partners from local, academic, and governmental agencies in developing or continuing protective measures for the marine environment on and around coral reefs, all while completing their comparative reef projects. Coral Reef Conservation: Caribbean will examine how local, academic, governmental, and international organizations and businesses are working together to conserve and sustainably manage Caribbean coral reef ecosystems.\nDates / Deadlines:\nDates / Deadlines: Term |  Year |  App Deadline |  Decision Date |  Start Date |  End Date  \n---|---|---|---|---|---  \nSpring |  2026  |  10/01/2025 **  |  Rolling Admission  |  TBA |  TBA  \n** Indicates rolling admission application process.
