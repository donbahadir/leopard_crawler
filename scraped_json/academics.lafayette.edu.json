Scholars work closely and collaboratively with faculty on significant research projects that hone critical-thinking and communication skills.\n  * Read articles about EXCEL Scholars projects.\n\n\nYou become a part of the program through nomination by a faculty member. As an EXCEL Scholar, you will be an integral part of the research process; the nature of the work is not clerical, nor is it primarily focused on routine chores.\nYou are challenged to make a significant contribution and are involved in all aspects of the research, from reading and analyzing articles to designing experiments, testing hypotheses, interpreting data, and writing articles about the results for publication.\n### Benefits\nEXCEL Scholars earn $9 to $11 an hour. They may work full time during the summer (10 weeks) and interim session (3 weeks in January). They may also work part time (8-10 hours per week) during the academic year.\nDuring the summer and interim session, EXCEL Scholars are also provided free college housing in the residence halls.\nBesides the stimulating academic challenge that the program provides, EXCEL Scholars have the opportunity to apply techniques and knowledge that they learn in class to specific problems. This kind of hands-on experience is an asset for students applying to graduate schools or seeking professional employment.\nYour participation may lead to a coauthored article published in a scholarly journal, a patent for equipment or a technique that you develop, or the creation of works of art. You may also present your findings at one or more professional conferences such as the annual National Conference on Undergraduate Research, which is held at a different college or university each year. Lafayette College has one of the largest contingents of student presenters at NCUR.\n### How to Get Involved\nThe program is open to sophomore, junior, and senior full-time Lafayette students in all disciplines who have at least a 3.00 GPA. Research opportunities are available in engineering, natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences.\nTo nominate an EXCEL Scholar, a faculty member submits a proposal to the Academic Research Committee. Faculty who have grants that support student research assistants may apply to have their students join the EXCEL Scholars program.\nThe program is central to Lafayette’s dedication to providing unique academic opportunities and promoting the personal mentoring of students by faculty. It began in 1986 with 14 students. The program now has an annual budget of over $500,000 with more than 160 students participating each year. The success has made the program a model for other colleges and universities. Support for EXCEL comes not only from outside faculty research grants, but also from endowments, private foundation grants, and College funds.\n### Lafayette College offers a variety of resources that support faculty and student research.\nFor information about College-funded programs for research by or with students, funding opportunities administered through the Academic Research Committee, and information from our Office of Sponsored Research, visit the Research Support site.\nClose Our Pulse Our People\n"

I have found that students learn the most from an engaging learning environment in which they constantly interact with their peers as well as the professor and apply the concepts learned from the class to real-world examples. \nIl Hyun Cho\nassociate professor of government and law and asian studies\nView profile \n> My approach to teaching is to present topics in a logical and organized fashion while connecting them to real-world applications, making the content more relevant and relatable. … As an instructor, I work hard to establish trusting and productive relationships with students and establish an environment where students feel comfortable and supported. \nMelissa Gordon\nassistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering\nView profile \n> I tell stories through images, static or moving, often using performance to ground them. My influences represent a broad swath of interests that include abstraction, politics, humor, feminism, and art history. … By calling into question how we understand history and the elusive nature of truth, my work reveals the subjectivity of both. \nKarina Aguilera Skvirsky\nprofessor of art\nView Profile \n> Working with undergraduates in the research lab is the most rewarding aspect of my position. While I could perform the experiments myself, it is much more enjoyable to work with students. \nChip Nataro\nmarshall r. metzgar professor of chemistry\nView profile \n> I am passionate about helping students understand that struggle is not a sign of incapability. In fact, productive struggle is a necessary part of achieving their goals. I am interested in thinking about how we teach this kind of mindset to offer even more value to our students. \nDaniel Sabatino\nassociate professor of mechanical engineering\nView profile \n> As students come from diverse backgrounds, it is important for them to learn to engage with one another’s thoughts and ideas on a level of civility and mutual respectfulness, especially when discussing a subject as potentially contentious as religion. I try to impart this conviction through the atmosphere of openness I cultivate in my classroom. \nEric Ziolkowski\nhead of religious studies department\nView profile \n> I joined Lafayette because I loved that I could teach undergraduates in a multidisciplinary department and engage in a broader community of learning that reached across the College. I’m interested in many different subjects and am lucky enough to be able to learn from colleagues all across campus. \nCaroline Lee\nprofessor of sociology\nView profile \n> I’m a geologist who specializes in volcanoes. I want to know why and how magma bodies form, evolve, destabilize, and erupt. … It’s exhilarating to see students have that first ‘aha!’ moment in research—whether it happens on the side of a volcano in Iceland, looking down a microscope in my lab, or plotting data to test a hypothesis. \nTamara Carley\nassociate professor of geology\nView profile \nPrevious Next\nSusan Averett \nPaul Barclay \nMichael Bertucci \nZoe Boekelheide \nAlexander Brown \nMike Butler \nTamara Carley \nIl Hyun Cho \nJustin Corvino \nDana Cuomo \nCaleb Gallemore \nKatherine Groo \nTrent Gaugler \nJoaquín Gómez-Miñambres \nMelissa Gordon ’11 \nHenry Hallock \nBrett Hendrickson \nJustin Hines \nEric Ho \nChrista Kelleher ’08 \nJennifer Kelly \nTim Laquintano \nCaroline Lee \nMeghan Masto ’03 \nBruce Allen Murphy \nLauren Myers \nChip Nataro \nMichael A.

    "markdown": "Lafayette encourages and recognizes superior academic work. Since 1926, students have had the opportunity to explore topics that interest them and distinguish themselves by pursuing honors in a particular major or interdisciplinary program.\nStudents who do honors projects are guided by a faculty member with whom they begin conversations well before the senior year. In many cases, the student has previously worked with the faculty member on an EXCEL Scholars research project or completed an independent study. Once the thesis is written, the student defends it before a committee that includes his or her mentor, all or part of the departmental faculty members, and in some cases, a guest faculty member from another college.\nTo qualify for honors, students must have a cumulative average of 3.00 and an average of 3.20 in the honors department. As seniors, they take the fall and spring thesis courses. The transcripts of students who receive honors bear the legend “Honors in [department or program name] with Thesis.”\n### Why Pursue Honors?\nStudents cite many reasons for deciding to strive for honors, including:\n  * preparation for graduate school\n  * employ research skills on a topic of personal interest\n  * techniques learned will be valuable for future plans\n  * synthesize four years of knowledge\n  * different learning experience than coursework\n  * combine two or more academic interests\n  * explore a topic in depth\n  * an accomplishment that demonstrates high ability\n  * an exciting challenge\n\n\nClose Our Pulse Our People\n"
