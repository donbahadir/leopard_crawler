_Grace Brokenshire ’24 is a civil engineering major who went abroad in spring 2022 on our . Grace is one of our global ambassadors for the 2022-23 school year. Here’s what she had to say about her time abroad:_
Coming into college, I was never actually planning on going abroad. But after a student mentor mentioned to me how early engineering students had to apply to go, I decided to apply just in case I ended up actually interested in the opportunity. I always kept in mind that I could drop from the program before I actually went. Fast forward about a year and I was getting on a plane to Bonn, Germany because after being accepted to my program, I never dropped out.
I stayed with a host family and had a host sister my age who is now one of my closest friends. I took a full course load of 5 classes with a mix of some required for my major and others filling common course of study requirements. I found the courses to be a bit less challenging than those I had previously taken on campus at Lafayette which allowed me to travel a lot more when I did not have class. Some of the best experiences I had while abroad were the trips my friends and I planned on our own and the study tours organized by our host school, AIB. Over the course of my 4 months in Germany, I was able to travel to France, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Austria, Netherlands, Switzerland, and almost 20 German cities.
One of my favorite parts of going abroad was bonding with 16 other engineers from Lafayette whom I might not have met otherwise. Having the shared experience of living in Bonn for all of that time, learning together, and traveling together is something I do not think any of us will ever forget. I will forever be grateful that I decided to apply to the program my freshman spring semester just in case; it truly was one of the best decisions I have ever made.

URL: https://studyabroad.lafayette.edu/2023/05/04/julie-schramm-24-reflects-on-her-time-in-japan/#page

Julie Schramm ’24 is a neuroscience major who went abroad in spring 2023 through our affiliated . She answered a few questions reflecting on her time studying in Japan.
_Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did?_
I love Japanese cuisine and am fascinated by the culture, which I knew little about prior to traveling to Japan. It is a destination that I have wanted to go to since I was very young.
_What was your favorite course abroad and why?_
My favorite course was definitely Practical Japanese for Study Abroad Students. I loved how the professor, Sensei Matsuhashi, focused heavily on culture in addition to language skills. We went on two field trips: a sumo tournament in Tokyo and carrot harvesting in the countryside of Chiba prefecture followed by paper cutting, a traditional Japanese craft. We also engaged with the culture and language through film, readings, and a final digital photo story project (narrated in Japanese) showcasing our study abroad experience.
_What was your favorite local food or drink abroad?_
Definitely _Tsukemen_ , or dipping noodles! It is different from traditional ramen in that the noodles are served separately from the broth.
_What was the most important thing that you learned abroad?_
The most important thing that I learned was how to be flexible and comfortable with change in a new country. Getting used to a new language, culture, transportation system, and school environment by myself and far away from home was not easy! However, it presented a challenge that allowed me to become more self-reliant and confident in myself. Being in a new environment also inspired curiosity and excitement, which was much needed!
_In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture?_
In addition to making friends with local students at my university who taught me a lot about the culture and daily life in Japan, I engaged by planning many excursions around Tokyo. I explored the music scene by going to a jazz bar and classical music concert, the art scene by visiting many museums, and the culinary scene by eating out at restaurants both near my dorm and around Tokyo. Additionally, I traveled to a few different cities in Japan: Kanazawa, Osaka, and Kyoto. Being able to compare and contrast the local cuisines, town layouts, histories, and even how locals interacted was truly unique!
_What tips do you have for students about to study abroad or considering going abroad?_
Cliché but… Go for it! Studying abroad is a great way to expand your cultural awareness, develop your sense of confidence and independence, and provide a change of scenery and routine. Also, don’t feel like you need to have a clear plan ahead of time; I went to Tokyo with little idea about what I wanted to see and where I wanted to travel. All of that takes form when you arrive! I can honestly say that my four months abroad were some of the best so far!
_In what ways did you grow as an individual while studying abroad?_
I definitely became more independent, as I navigated life on my own in a different country for four months (with a 13-hour time difference from home!). I also became more comfortable with going on solo outings. I made a big effort to fill my days with activities and maximize the limited time that I had in Japan. I think that I also grew more comfortable with acclimating to change. While it was a bit daunting to arrive in a country where everything was new, successfully adjusting to the many lifestyle and cultural differences gave me self-confidence and the reassurance that I could do this again, in another country.
_What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience?_
Hanging out with the deer in Nara. And visiting the many surrounding temples, especially Todaiji.

Ruben Hernandez ’24 is a math and economics major who studied abroad in fall 2022 through our program. Ruben was also a recipient of the federal Gilman Scholarship. He answered a few questions about his time in San Jose, Costa Rica with Universidad LCI Veritas.
_Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did?_
I chose to visit Costa Rica in order to improve my Spanish and communication skills with Ticos. I wanted to experience a beautiful tropical country and learn the customs of another Spanish-speaking country, which wasn’t entirely unfamiliar to me as I am Afro-Latino. I also wanted to treat this experience as a restful time and just treat it as a learning experience while enjoying wildlife, doing different activities, and having the company of new friends.
_What was your favorite course abroad and why?_
My favorite course was “Sustainability: Consumption and Production,” as I gained a ton of information surrounding the international market of consumer items, specifically how consumer items were produced. There are many processes that go into a pair of jeans in other countries that many consumers aren’t aware of, which are at times harmful to the producers.
_What was your favorite local food or drink abroad?_
My favorite dish was called a chifrijo, a Costa Rican appetizer that typically includes chips, salsa, beans, rice, and fried pork.
_What was the most important thing that you learned abroad?_
I was reminded to always count your blessings and to live in the moment.
_In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture?_
I set up my own excursions with a local travel company and went on trips with them. I also engaged in conversations with some local business owners.
_What tips do you have for students about to study abroad or considering going abroad?_
Don’t focus on the classes you want to take and decide what experience you desire as a whole.
_In what ways did you grow as an individual while studying abroad?_
I became better at communicating with others and allowed myself to go through life one day at a time.
_What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience?_
My fondest memory is taking a group trip to Panama with the people I met and learning to navigate the new setting together with everyone’s company.

Eline Pellicano ’24 is an international affairs major who studied abroad in fall 2022 through and in winter 2023 through our program. She received the Gilman Scholarship for her winter Senegal program. Eline is one of our 2023-24 Assante-Carrasco Scholars, and her senior thesis is inspired by her work over the summer at a women’s refugee charity in Brixton, London.
_What was your favorite course abroad and why?_
One of my favorite courses abroad was entitled “Migration Technology and Humanitarianism,” which discussed the use of biometric data in EU immigration systems. I learned so much about refugee systems in that course and, paired with lessons of British racial politics in Professor Nandini Sikand’s “Empire Strikes Back” class, it showed me an area of scholarship I’ve become really passionate about.
_What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience?_
One of my most cherished experiences in my time abroad was being on the train from London to Edinburgh with our Lafayette cohort, looking out the window and marveling at the changing landscape. We witnessed the breathtaking beauty of the country outside the urban setting of London, from green pastures to the sparkling blue sea. It was a scenic four-hour ride. Every once in a while, someone would shout, “Look at the sheep,” and we’d laugh. When we arrived in Edinburgh, we were greeted by the sound of bagpipes right away. It felt like a different world.

Will Garvin ’24 is a Government and Law major and volunteers as one of our Global Ambassadors. He studied abroad during his spring 2023 semester through .
_Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did?_
I’ve wanted to live or study in Spain since I was a kid, and when Lafayette provided me the opportunity to go I took it. I chose Seville because I heard great things about it from previous friends who went.
_What was your favorite course abroad and why?_
“Spanish Culture and Society.” I became really close with the professor, who would go out of his way to take us to different churches and historical buildings in Seville.
_What was the most important thing that you learned abroad?_
How to be independent. I went alone with no other Lafayette students, and I came out meeting so many people that became key parts of my experience there.
_In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture?_
Whether it was getting a sandwich in the mornings or going out at night with other Spaniards, you get the sense that being social is a big part of the local culture.
_What tips do you have for students about to study abroad or considering going abroad?_
Try to meet as many people as you can. It’s the most rewarding experience when you’re able to. If you’re feeling stuck because you want to go with people you already know, don’t worry about that. I went by myself and met so many great people in Seville.
_In what ways did you grow as an individual while studying abroad?_
I became better at putting myself in uncomfortable situations that resulted in positive experiences with other people.
_What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience?_
The different people I was able to meet and the culture that Seville was able to offer.

Will Garvin ’24 is a Government and Law major and volunteers as one of our Global Ambassadors. He studied abroad during his spring 2023 semester through .
_Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did?_
I’ve wanted to live or study in Spain since I was a kid, and when Lafayette provided me the opportunity to go I took it. I chose Seville because I heard great things about it from previous friends who went.
_What was your favorite course abroad and why?_
“Spanish Culture and Society.” I became really close with the professor, who would go out of his way to take us to different churches and historical buildings in Seville.
_What was the most important thing that you learned abroad?_
How to be independent. I went alone with no other Lafayette students, and I came out meeting so many people that became key parts of my experience there.
_In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture?_
Whether it was getting a sandwich in the mornings or going out at night with other Spaniards, you get the sense that being social is a big part of the local culture.
_What tips do you have for students about to study abroad or considering going abroad?_
Try to meet as many people as you can. It’s the most rewarding experience when you’re able to. If you’re feeling stuck because you want to go with people you already know, don’t worry about that. I went by myself and met so many great people in Seville.
_In what ways did you grow as an individual while studying abroad?_
I became better at putting myself in uncomfortable situations that resulted in positive experiences with other people.
_What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience?_
The different people I was able to meet and the culture that Seville was able to offer.

Samantha Semsel ’25 is a Government and Law major who studied abroad in spring 2024 through Spanish Studies Abroad’s program.
_Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did?_
I chose Sevilla because it was quite the opposite of where I live in a lot of ways. Andalusians (which is the southern province of Spain where Sevilla is) value family and community, and life is considerably slower. I definitely felt like it has helped me grow and I have improved my Spanish tremendously
_What was your favorite course abroad?_
Spanish Modern Politics.
_What was your favorite local food or drink abroad?_
Tinto de Verano and Moroccan chicken (from when I visited Morocco).
_What was the most important thing that you learned abroad?_
That sometimes living abroad can be frustrating and difficult, but the reality is those moments are when you learn the most.
_In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture?_
Semana Santa (Holy Week) is an extremely important holiday week in Sevilla and my parents came to see the processions. It’s definitely an experience of a lifetime.
_What tips do you have for students about to study abroad or considering going abroad?_
Don’t get stuck in your ways, or else you will become very unhappy. Some people I know wouldn’t make the effort to try and live in the city and interact with the local community and cuisine, and they were the most unhappy.
_In what ways did you grow as an individual while studying abroad?_
I have always been a fast-paced person and definitely very anxious. Some part of that I believe is part of the hustle culture I grew up in. Sevilla taught me to slow down and enjoy life. Also, I think this experience has definitely helped my anxious mind as well.
_What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience?_
I went to the Sahara in Morocco with the Erasmus Club of Sevilla–an incredible experience! We camped in the desert one night in traditional Berber tents and also visited Fes. I’m so glad I traveled outside of Europe during my time abroad even though I chose a European country. Sevilla is located in southern Spain which allowed me easier access to Morocco without even taking a plane.

# Once Lost, I Lithify: A student’s poetic exploration of geology
McKenna Graf ’26 participated in the summer 2024 GEOL 160: Geology of the National Parks in the Western USA program. Deeply inspired by the immense beauty and geological history they witnessed, they compiled a collection of poems. Experience the western national parks through McKenna’s lovely writing!
### Once Lost, I Lithify: An Archive of Experiencing the Geology of the Colorado Plateau
"I'm a poet and went on this trip hoping to get some inspiration for work as all great writers and people do. We go to the woods and often find our outlook changed. I went on the Geology National Parks and thought I would just leave sore and tired. Instead I found myself greatly inspired by the National Parks and what they had to offer. I wrote almost everyday about what I was learning and seeing. The geological concepts were difficult for me to learn but I found a great source of empowerment in allowing myself to try and learn it differently. I immersed myself in the spaces and wrote about it in ways I could understand, poetry. I left with a greater grasp on my independence and strength. I did it in my way as I felt freed by the millions of years we so casually walked through and documented through rocks. I wanted to share the words that were sparked." - McKenna Graf '26

Harvest Gil ’25 is a geology major who studied abroad in spring 2024 through program.
Expand All Collapse All
### Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did? 
I’ve grown up around Easton and wanted to spend a semester somewhere I have never been. I adore traveling and knew I wouldn’t have this chance to go somewhere like Australia for four months again. Cairns really stood out to me by offering a range of ecosystems to immerse myself in. I knew I couldn’t turn this opportunity away. I wanted to go somewhere flooded with peculiarities and somewhere without anyone or anything that I had known before.
### What was your favorite course abroad and why? 
Cultural anthropology and the environment. Similar to culture, knowledge, and the environment at Lafayette, this course dived into relationships between the humans, cultures, and ecosystems of North Queensland Australia. It was quite eye-opening to compare long-term practices of environmental protection to ethics and cultural distinctions.
### What was your favorite local food or drink abroad? 
The tropical fruit in North Queensland was marvelous. Australia also has the best coffee in the world.
### What was the most important thing that you learned abroad? 
That I have complete control over my life. I learned how to listen to myself and learn from past experiences. I was fortunate enough to only be with one other American, and during this time we pushed each other out of our comfort zones and ended up being completely free to make our own decisions no matter the outcome. It was an amazing experience being able to do so in a place so dissimilar to any of the other countries I have been to.
### In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture? 
I was heavily involved with the Australian Marine Conservation Society towards the end of my visit and was able to grasp a better understanding of how their non-profit organization worked. Other than that, I made many friends from around the area and was involved in some community groups on campus as well. Our program also introduced us to the culture of aboriginal lands and the people of FNQ (far north Queensland) by sending the two of us on excursions to learn about their history.
### What tips do you have for students about to study abroad or considering going abroad? 
Do something different! It is a great way to extract yourself from the known and put yourself out of your comfort zone. Don’t be afraid to try something new or scary and always remember that you are not alone if you do decide to make a drastic change.
### In what ways did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
Too many ways honestly. I became much more patient and understanding of other people around me. I think that I also really did learn to appreciate and understand my flaws as well. I was definitely able to grow in more ways than one by being alone most of the time too, which was a positive for me and allowed me to embrace every single part of me. I feel more connected to myself and much more appreciative of being humbled and naïve.
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
It’s hard to pick one out of the many, but I would say having the opportunity to travel. I spent a week in Fiji doing a project with the Peace Corps and CaPA Scholars focusing on music as a community builder. It was phenomenal to be able to experience such a beautiful area with a remarkable community. It wasn’t in Australia but if I hadn’t gone out there, I would have never been able to immerse myself in such a different culture. It was truly an honor to be welcomed into their village and explore their ways of living and loving through community.

Expand All Collapse All
### What made you choose your study abroad program? 
I chose this program because I had a previous student recommend it to me after I told her that I would like to study abroad in Athens, Greece.
### What was your favorite course and why? 
My favorite course abroad was my Trauma and the Remaking of Self course with a clinical psychologist. She was able to split the course between class lectures and field trips to refugee camps and other places that tell the story of a particular group of people’s traumatic experiences. It allowed me to gain another perspective of Greece that was more realistic instead of touristy.
### What was your favorite local food or drink? 
My favorite local drink was Greek frappe every so often because I do not drink coffee very often. My favorite food was pastitsio.
### What was the most important thing that you learned? 
The most important thing I learned abroad was how to adapt to Greek culture. The US is a much more fast-paced environment so I had to walk slower than I usually do.
### How did you interact with the local community and culture? 
The local bars and cafes were great ways to interact with locals, especially after ordering with an American accent people became extremely curious. Another great way was through traveling to the multitude of Greek islands which have smaller populations and speaking with the locals about their family history.
### What tips do you have for students interested in going abroad? 
This is the only time you will be able to travel independently, but simultaneously supported by Lafayette College and the accompanying program as a student, so _cur non_?
### How did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
I came back to America with a greater sense of confidence in myself. I was determined to travel a bit throughout Europe and at first was scared to leave Athens because I knew I would have to try and survive in an even more unfamiliar area, but I always brought a friend and we tackled each obstacle like adults. While visiting places like France, Spain, and London I developed transferable skills like problem-solving and teamwork that I will value forever.
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
There are so many, but one of the most cherished memories would be the late-night sweet treat runs my closest friends and I would do once a week.

# Federal Gilman scholarship supports Kat Flanders’ enriching abroad experience
Kat Flanders '25 is a recipient of the federal Gilman scholarship and is a global ambassador for International and Off-Campus Education. 
_Kat Flanders studied abroad in summer 2022 through Lafayette’s faculty-led From Plate to Plate: The Geology and Agriculture of Food in Italy program, and again in spring 2024 through Syracuse University Florence. She received theGilman scholarship for her spring semester abroad, and as a Gilman scholar, completed a follow-on service project about her international experiences._
I’ve known since high school that I wanted to study internationally. On college tours, I would always ask about opportunities abroad. Two summers ago, I did a three-week trip through Lafayette to Italy, where we learned about its geology, food, and agriculture, hiked volcanos, went on a boat tour, tasted wine and cheese, and more. When I was researching my semester-long experience, Italy was a no-brainer, especially Florence; its enrichment of art, culture, history, food, and beauty, all in the grasp of a walkable city, completely captivated me. One of my biggest stressors, however, was costs; how would I finance an entire semester abroad?
I come from a middle-class family with high financial need and knew the importance of starting my financing journey early. Scholarships instantly came to mind when thinking about affording study abroad. While I applied for many scholarships, one of the main ones was the U.S. Department of State’s Benjamin A. Gilman International Scholarship, a program that offers funding to undergraduate Pell Grant recipients who may not get the chance to participate otherwise due to financial struggles. In addition to providing up to $5,000 for a semester and up to $10,000 for the year, the Gilman program also ensures skills and resources for national security. What stuck out to me when further reviewing this scholarship was the importance placed on expanding the number of people who get to study internationally, therefore also increasing the important skills of representing American culture and values, building connections, and becoming our future leaders.
Through the generosity of the Gilman scholarship, I was able to not only fund myself in Florence – getting to enjoy what felt like all of the pasta in the world – but also travel all over Italy and Europe; Pisa, Siena, Venice, Rome, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Paris, Barcelona, and Nice! I was able to find a balance between exploring and becoming culturally situated in Florence, whether that was attending less visited museums or finding my favorite hole in the wall, yet still getting to have fun traveling and seeing some of the most beautiful places in Europe! I created a custom Google map to outline some of my favorite abroad adventures, from site visits for my classes to visiting the Heineken museum in Amsterdam, and eating some of the best Chinese food I’ve ever had!
The Gilman scholarship’s generous award was more than just financial support; my abroad program helped develop my cultural understanding and experiences. I took a Mapping Italy course, which educated me on the cultural differences between Italians and Americans and how to appropriately work through culture shock. I was able to interact with local Italians through my Italian 101 course. We visited a farmer’s market where we practiced asking questions and ordering items in Italian, allowing us to have fun and informed conversations with locals. In addition, we worked conversationally with local high school students, where they got to practice their English and we got to practice our Italian. On my own, I formed a personal relationship with my favorite cafe. This small shop was right across the street from my apartment and was my go-to for coffee and croissants; the owners and I got to know each other well and formed a positive bond. One of the most pivotal aspects of the Gilman program is to nurture and enforce mutual understanding between citizens of the U.S. and abroad. Because of this, I was able to consciously contribute to a local Italian community and build meaningful connections.
I genuinely do not know how I would’ve gone abroad without the Gilman program. Other scholarships and savings helped, but Gilman is what allowed me to feel comfortable and safe, and pursue all of my opportunities. My study abroad experience shaped the person I am today; I am much more independent, confident, and aware of my surroundings. I have developed a deeper cultural understanding of the world around me, and now consistently consider it in my everyday life and relationships. None of that would have happened without Gilman, and for that, I am forever grateful.

# Kat Flanders ’25 revisits her time in Florence
Kat Flanders ’25 is one of our global ambassadors. She studied abroad twice at Lafayette; through Syracuse University Florence in spring 2024 and with our faculty-led program From Plate to Plate: The Geology and Agriculture of Food in Italy in summer 2022.
Expand All Collapse All
### Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did? 
I wanted to go to an American university so I could assimilate a little easier and find a good balance of being immersed in the culture without it being too overwhelming. I really wanted to go to Florence because it is small enough that it’s easy to navigate, yet has endless things to do and explore. In addition, it is so incredibly beautiful and full of so much rich history and art. Italy in general never gets old; the best food, views, and places to explore!
### What was your favorite course abroad and why? 
My experimental music course was definitely my favorite. It was fun, interactive, completely different than what I’ve taken before, and my professor was awesome. She was energetic, quirky, and taught in a way I could easily understand. 
### What was your favorite local food or drink abroad? 
I have to say pasta for Italy! I have a whole note in my phone of some of my favorite places, there’s just so many! One of my favorite dishes specifically is cacio e pepe!
### What was the most important thing that you learned abroad? 
To be completely independent and confident. Especially in the beginning, I was homesick and it took me a little bit to adjust, but there was nothing I could do except force myself to explore, meet new people, and try new things! Being abroad really teaches you a new sense of self and shows you how much you’re capable of. 
### In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture? 
In my Italian 101 course, we did various field trips where we practiced ordering at a local farmers market, visited a local artisan shop, and conversed with high schoolers so that they could practice their English and we could practice our Italian. I also had my go-to coffee shop across the street from my apartment; the couple working there were the best! In my art history course, half of our class was spent at museums (ones I wouldn’t have even seen without that class). 
### What tips do you have for students about to study abroad or considering going abroad? 
Definitely start saving as early as possible and look into scholarships. I wish I started saving earlier. I also think it is beneficial to have this experience for yourself and not go where all of your friends do; it forces you to get out of your comfort zone and meet some of the best friends you’ll have!
### In what ways did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
I definitely became super self-sufficient. Traveling alone, figuring things out in the moment, meeting new friends, attending a new university, living in a new city, etc. forces you to grow up and mature in the best way possible. Who I was when I left is definitely not who I am today. I am much more independent, confident, and self-assured. 
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
Probably living in Florence and meeting some of my new lifelong friends. Florence is truly an incredibly magical city, full of beauty, opportunity, and a version of myself that I’ll always cherish. It holds a lot of memories, and for that, I’ll be forever grateful. The people I met through this program are now some of my closest friends, friends I can’t imagine ever not knowing.

# Kat Flanders ’25 revisits her time in Florence
Kat Flanders ’25 is one of our global ambassadors. She studied abroad twice at Lafayette; through Syracuse University Florence in spring 2024 and with our faculty-led program From Plate to Plate: The Geology and Agriculture of Food in Italy in summer 2022.
Expand All Collapse All
### Why did you choose the study abroad program that you did? 
I wanted to go to an American university so I could assimilate a little easier and find a good balance of being immersed in the culture without it being too overwhelming. I really wanted to go to Florence because it is small enough that it’s easy to navigate, yet has endless things to do and explore. In addition, it is so incredibly beautiful and full of so much rich history and art. Italy in general never gets old; the best food, views, and places to explore!
### What was your favorite course abroad and why? 
My experimental music course was definitely my favorite. It was fun, interactive, completely different than what I’ve taken before, and my professor was awesome. She was energetic, quirky, and taught in a way I could easily understand. 
### What was your favorite local food or drink abroad? 
I have to say pasta for Italy! I have a whole note in my phone of some of my favorite places, there’s just so many! One of my favorite dishes specifically is cacio e pepe!
### What was the most important thing that you learned abroad? 
To be completely independent and confident. Especially in the beginning, I was homesick and it took me a little bit to adjust, but there was nothing I could do except force myself to explore, meet new people, and try new things! Being abroad really teaches you a new sense of self and shows you how much you’re capable of. 
### In what ways did you interact with your local community and culture? 
In my Italian 101 course, we did various field trips where we practiced ordering at a local farmers market, visited a local artisan shop, and conversed with high schoolers so that they could practice their English and we could practice our Italian.

Global ambassador Chrissie Burrows ’25 is a history major and econ minor who studied abroad through in fall 2023.
Expand All Collapse All
### What made you choose your study abroad program? 
I wanted to study abroad in Dublin as I had gone with my family for a vacation and I loved the city. Also, having spent most summers in England visiting my family there, I wanted to be close to them so I had a support system while also being far enough to have my own independence. I also wanted to go to an academically focused program at a highly accredited university.
### What was your favorite course and why? 
My favorite course was Medieval Irish History. I learned a lot about a history that I did not know and is not really taught in America. It was also interesting to hear about Ireland before English colonization.
### What was your favorite local food or drink? 
I loved Guinness (it truly is different from the U.S.).
### What was the most important thing that you learned? 
How to travel safely either alone or with a group of people. Especially in a city that you do not know.
### How did you interact with the local community and culture? 
In my program I was actually taking Trinity classes, they weren’t classes only for study abroad students. So I was working on projects with Irish students. Also, as silly as it sounds, going to the local pub, even for a quick bite to eat, we were almost always asked about life in America because they would overhear our accents. The people I interacted with truly were the nicest.
### What tips do you have for students interested in going abroad? 
It may be scary going to a program outside of Lafayette, but it is worth it. I was the only student from Lafayette in my program, however, the other IFSA people I met were truly the nicest and are some of my closest friends now and we still keep in touch (almost every day). So while being the only Laf person seems daunting, there is a built-in support system with you there going with other students in the affiliated program.
### How did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
I learned to become independent and branch out. I was nervous about being the only person from Lafayette in my program, but putting myself out there allowed me to make the friends I did.
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
Meeting my group of friends and walking around Dublin for the first time. That walk around Dublin, getting Boba Tea was what solidified our friendship there.

Nicholas Webster ’27 is a global ambassador who studied abroad in summer 2024 through our Florence: Language, Art, and Culture faculty-led program.
Expand All Collapse All
### What made you choose your study abroad program? 
Growing up, I always had an interest in traveling and studying abroad. The Lafayette interim study abroad programs allowed me to spend part of my summer studying in a new environment for a short period. I decided to study in Florence, Italy, because it is a destination I have heard about and have always planned on visiting. This program also seemed to focus on cultural and language immersion and history, which I am incredibly interested in.
### What was your favorite course and why? 
For the interim study abroad course, we all took only one class, Italian. The rest of the course involved tours and other cultural activities. I enjoyed the Italian course as it was both interesting and allowed me to use new language skills in a foreign country.
### What was your favorite local food or drink? 
I ate pasta pretty much every day while in Italy. By far, the pasta I ate the most was pappardelle with ragu sauce. This delicious dish originated in Tuscany and was great for both lunch and dinner.
### What was the most important thing that you learned? 
The most important thing I learned was how to embrace the local culture and learn to adapt to environments different from my own. Living in Italy was very different from the United States, and learning to adapt to the differences was challenging but rewarding. In my opinion, the best aspect of studying abroad is adapting to the different cultures and environments.
### How did you interact with the local community and culture? 
We interacted with the local community and culture a ton. A major component of this program was cultural immersion, which involved engaging with local traditions and living as a local would. We lived in a Florentine apartment and ate food at local establishments. Using public transportation was a great opportunity to engage with the local community.
### What tips do you have for students interested in going abroad? 
Go and explore! If you have free time, explore the city and surrounding areas. One weekend, I traveled independently to the city of San Gimignano. While there, a medieval festival began in the middle of the city, in which games and music were played for hours. This was a highlight of my trip, and it was possible because I went out and explored.
### How did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
Studying abroad required me to live independently in a way I never had before. Living in an apartment in a foreign area, finding my way to class every morning, figuring out public transportation, and searching for places where to get food was a very different experience, especially doing all of this in a foreign country. I found out how adaptable I can be in new situations.
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
My most cherished memory from my abroad experience was traveling independently to the city of San Gimignano. I will never forget walking through the medieval streets of the city and seeing the large and very old towers looming overhead. What was supposed to be a trip that lasted a few hours ended up taking the entire day as an annual medieval festival occurred where games and traditional music were played. I saw the most exciting tug-of-war match I had ever seen. After the festival concluded, I got dinner at a restaurant overlooking the rolling hills of Tuscany.

# Gateway Alumni Spotlight: Samantha Jordan ’13
## Alumni Spotlight
### Samantha Jordan '13
Samantha Jordan '13 is a foreign service officer for the US State Department. She received a bachelor of arts in international economics from Lafayette and a masters in public policy from the Harvard Kennedy School.
Expand All Collapse All
### What does your employer do? 
The Department of State advises the President and leads the nation in foreign policy issues to advance the interests and security of the American people. The State Department negotiates treaties and agreements with foreign entities, and manages America’s relationships with foreign governments, international organizations, and the people of other countries.
### What do you do in your role? 
As an economic officer I help build and maintain positive economic and trade relations between the U.S. and other countries. I work with U.S. and foreign government officials, business leaders, and international organizations to promote national security through economic security. In my former position in the Office of Macroeconomic Affairs, that meant monitoring post-pandemic developments in the Western Hemisphere and supporting sovereign debt negotiations.
### What gets you excited to go to work each day? 
The amazing people I get to meet, learn from and work with! In my last job I had the pleasure of working on the State Department’s study abroad programs – Gilman, IDEAS, and the Critical Language Scholarship Program (CLS), that allow incredible young students to study abroad and gain the experiences and skills that will prove invaluable as they embark on careers in a range of fields. I get hope from young leaders like the nursing student who studied Russian through CLS with hopes of providing healthcare services to Ukrainian refugees.
### What keeps you up at night as you think about the opportunities (or challenges) related to your work? 
Historically, it is not unique for the U.S. to face challenges on multiple international fronts. That said, the depth and breadth of current challenges we face –from the Middle East to climate change– are overwhelming. The pandemic showed us that there are some challenges that are too severe for any single country to overcome alone. We must work in alignment with our partners, while taking a strong stance against our competitors.
### What key strengths are necessary to be successful in entering this career field? 
Adaptability, because over the course of your career you will work in a diverse range of countries and with different cultures. Teamwork, because diplomacy is about leveraging the strengths of our teams and working with a wide range of stakeholders. Finally, communication, both oral and written, is key to advancing our diplomatic efforts.
### Is education beyond a Lafayette degree required to pursue this path? 
State Department employees come from very diverse educational backgrounds. Masters degrees are not required. If you are interested in a career in diplomacy, I encourage you to check out careers.state.gov for more information on different career paths.
### How did your Lafayette experience equip you for success in your career field, especially as an early career professional? 
International Affairs with Professor Park equipped me with frameworks for understanding international relations. Being a Writing Associate and helping other fellow students craft their writing skills helped me learn to write more concisely and persuasively. Finally, Dean Goldberg was essential in helping me prepare for my interview for the Pickering Fellowship.
### What specific experiences during your time at Lafayette made the greatest impact on your professional path? 
Studying abroad in Paris the summer after my sophomore year instilled a love of travel, language, and engaging with different cultures that has persisted until today. As a student-athlete on the basketball team, I learned discipline, teamwork, and time management skills that prepared me for life after Lafayette.
### As it relates to career exploration and development, what is one thing that you know now that you wish you could go back in time and tell your student self? 
With a liberal arts degree, I’ve found your major doesn’t matter much after graduation. I had a pretty diverse course load, but I wish I had taken even more classes across a range of fields that interested me.
### What advice do you have for students interested in pursuing your career field? 
Study abroad!
### What strategies, tools, or other efforts do you utilize to find balance or reduce your career-related stress? 
I strive to create distinction between family time and being on the clock. It’s important to rest. I’ve also found workouts are really important for my mood and well-being.
### How do you enjoy spending your free time when not at work? 
My love language is quality time. So I enjoy hanging out with my family and friends. It can be as simple as going on a hike or having a meal together. Since we are often living abroad, I cherish time with my loved ones.
### What was your favorite spot on Lafayette’s campus when you were a student? 
Is it weird that I am thinking of all my favorite foods? Penne with vodka sauce from Campus Pizza, a sandwich from Simon’s Cafe, the Lambretti at Farinon, Friday hot wings at Marquis.

Jacob Ingwer ’25 is an A&S major and one of our global ambassadors. He studied abroad his spring 2024 semester in Copenhagen, Denmark through .
Expand All Collapse All
### What made you choose your study abroad program? 
I had friends who completed DIS Copenhagen before I applied for abroad and they had a fantastic experience.
### What was your favorite course and why? 
This is a tough question to answer because I loved many of my classes. I would have to say the pop culture and media discourse class I took was pretty awesome. The professor was friendly and down to earth which made class discussions super engaging and fun.
### What was your favorite local food or drink? 
The durum kebabs near Norreport and Osterport!
### What was the most important thing that you learned? 
Don’t wait for things to happen. Make things happen!
### How did you interact with the local community and culture? 
I had a visiting host family when I was abroad and they helped me connect with Danish culture. We went out to food markets, music, bars, and even a local soccer match!
### What tips do you have for students interested in going abroad? 
It’s totally normal to feel nervous about going abroad. I know I felt nervous before going but in hindsight it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Believe in yourself! If you are debating going abroad I would reach out to anyone you know who has been abroad in order to learn more before you make your final decision.
### How did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
I became more independent and self-reliant when I went abroad. I think it is sort of inevitable someone becomes more independent when they go abroad, but that’s a good thing. You become more confident in your choices as you go grocery shopping by yourself, navigate a new city by yourself, and travel by yourself.
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
During our version of spring break, I traveled to Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Lisbon with a friend. It was awesome to be able to experience so many different cultures and do so many fun activities in such a short amount of time. By the end we were exhausted but I wouldn’t change a thing.

Bryan Osipower ’26 is a mechanical engineering major who studied abroad in spring 2024 through our .
Expand All Collapse All
### What made you choose your study abroad program? 
I was looking for a program that allowed me to easily stay on track with all my courses, but mainly I wanted to get a more international education inside of the engineering field. It’s fascinating that not everyone has the same method of doing things, especially within engineering, and I wanted to see if different countries strongly differed in their processes. (Also, Germany is in a great location for travel.)
### What was your favorite course and why? 
Urban Art and Architecture, taught by a local German professor and artist. This course analyzed nearly every aspect of art and architecture around the German urban environments (hence the name), but also all of the graffiti and street art that covered the street walls. We would frequently go on class walks to look at all of the local architecture and street art surrounding our academic building and even had to maintain a sketchbook throughout the entire course. Our final project was to present our sketchbooks, and we got to draw in each other’s, so we have a more personal, yet diverse experience. Professor Johannes Stahl was absolutely incredible! He would frequently take us out to coffee or a local bakery during our class, so we felt refreshed. He was also from my host town, so I was fortunate enough to go on some small-scale trips with him around Siegburg, Germany, exploring the rich heritage of the area. I had some of my best academic memories from this class and if I could only choose one thing to take away, it would be that “context matters.”
### What was your favorite local food or drink? 
As typical as it may be, my first and last meal in Bonn was a bratwurst and it was excellent. My favorite drink by far was the Radler, which originated in southern Germany. The best ones I had were in Austria.
### What was the most important thing that you learned? 
It is so important to be adaptable. I went abroad during a very unusual time in which Germany was having a number of transportation strikes. Being that my host family’s home was further away, these strikes hit us a little harder. Because of this, clear communication, quick thinking, and planning ahead really came in handy when getting myself to and from class. When you travel, expect things to never go as planned, especially when traveling for the first time, like I did. Nothing in life is perfect so it’s important to expect change: trains may get delayed, a certain location is closed, etc. As long as you are confident with yourself and aren’t afraid to adapt to life, everything will work out.
### How did you interact with the local community and culture? 
I was not a strong German speaker. However, I would try to immerse myself any way I could, whether it was by ordering food, talking with my host family, or even giving directions in German. I highly recommend that you try to celebrate any special holidays your host country has. For example, my cohort was able to walk in a Karneval (the “Fifth Season” in Germany) parade with so many locals. People dressed up in all types of costumes and threw candy out into the crowd, who were also fully dressed in costume. Overall, just an amazing experience.
### What tips do you have for students interested in going abroad? 
If you have any nerves for going abroad, don’t! It is such a fulfilling experience, and you learn so much, both about yourself and wherever you go. “Do things with the confidence of a four-year-old in a Batman costume.” In my opinion, it is better to chase the things you want to do (such as going abroad) rather than have them just be things you constantly think about.
### How did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
I learned to be totally independent and how to be comfortable with fully taking care of myself. However, I also learned that I had an amazing cohort who came for the same experience I did and that they were and always will be a resource available to me. I learned how to cook, travel, book a hotel, (somewhat) speak another language, how to present ideas to an international audience, and so much more.
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
I have so many! I had just put together a photo album of my time abroad and I realized that I have so many more memories than I initially thought. My most cherished memory, would probably be my final big trip to Budapest, Hungary. I had gone with three of my now best friends and we had packed so much adventure into just three days. It started with accidentally taking a wrong train that had a heating problem (very hot!) at around 2 to 3 am, then getting off that train and somehow still managing to hop on the right one.
Once in Budapest, we stayed at a very nice apartment-style hotel that we got for surprisingly good price. We had gotten eggs to make for breakfast, but our new stovetop was not working so the receptionist ended up making them for us. Then, I found out that sending roughly 26 back-and-forth emails to a Hungarian local can get you and your friends a very cheap 13 km canoe ride down the Danube River (thank you, Zsolt!). Later that night, we went on a boat cruise (again on the Danube River) through the heart of Budapest and got to see everything.
Overall, with the major events we did, exploring the city, and even food, our Budapest trip totaled to only about $100. On the train ride back to Germany, we also stopped to briefly explore Bratislava, Slovakia and Vienna, Austria.

### What made you choose your study abroad program? 
I was looking for a program that allowed me to easily stay on track with all my courses, but mainly I wanted to get a more international education inside of the engineering field. It’s fascinating that not everyone has the same method of doing things, especially within engineering, and I wanted to see if different countries strongly differed in their processes. (Also, Germany is in a great location for travel.)
### What was your favorite course and why? 
Urban Art and Architecture, taught by a local German professor and artist. This course analyzed nearly every aspect of art and architecture around the German urban environments (hence the name), but also all of the graffiti and street art that covered the street walls. We would frequently go on class walks to look at all of the local architecture and street art surrounding our academic building and even had to maintain a sketchbook throughout the entire course. Our final project was to present our sketchbooks, and we got to draw in each other’s, so we have a more personal, yet diverse experience. Professor Johannes Stahl was absolutely incredible! He would frequently take us out to coffee or a local bakery during our class, so we felt refreshed. He was also from my host town, so I was fortunate enough to go on some small-scale trips with him around Siegburg, Germany, exploring the rich heritage of the area. I had some of my best academic memories from this class and if I could only choose one thing to take away, it would be that “context matters.”
### What was your favorite local food or drink? 
As typical as it may be, my first and last meal in Bonn was a bratwurst and it was excellent. My favorite drink by far was the Radler, which originated in southern Germany. The best ones I had were in Austria.
### What was the most important thing that you learned? 
It is so important to be adaptable. I went abroad during a very unusual time in which Germany was having a number of transportation strikes. Being that my host family’s home was further away, these strikes hit us a little harder. Because of this, clear communication, quick thinking, and planning ahead really came in handy when getting myself to and from class. When you travel, expect things to never go as planned, especially when traveling for the first time, like I did. Nothing in life is perfect so it’s important to expect change: trains may get delayed, a certain location is closed, etc. As long as you are confident with yourself and aren’t afraid to adapt to life, everything will work out.
### How did you interact with the local community and culture? 
I was not a strong German speaker. However, I would try to immerse myself any way I could, whether it was by ordering food, talking with my host family, or even giving directions in German. I highly recommend that you try to celebrate any special holidays your host country has. For example, my cohort was able to walk in a Karneval (the “Fifth Season” in Germany) parade with so many locals. People dressed up in all types of costumes and threw candy out into the crowd, who were also fully dressed in costume. Overall, just an amazing experience.
### What tips do you have for students interested in going abroad? 
If you have any nerves for going abroad, don’t! It is such a fulfilling experience, and you learn so much, both about yourself and wherever you go. “Do things with the confidence of a four-year-old in a Batman costume.” In my opinion, it is better to chase the things you want to do (such as going abroad) rather than have them just be things you constantly think about.
### How did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
I learned to be totally independent and how to be comfortable with fully taking care of myself. However, I also learned that I had an amazing cohort who came for the same experience I did and that they were and always will be a resource available to me. I learned how to cook, travel, book a hotel, (somewhat) speak another language, how to present ideas to an international audience, and so much more.

Jacob Ingwer ’25 is an A&S major and one of our global ambassadors. He studied abroad his spring 2024 semester in Copenhagen, Denmark through .
Expand All Collapse All
### What made you choose your study abroad program? 
I had friends who completed DIS Copenhagen before I applied for abroad and they had a fantastic experience.
### What was your favorite course and why? 
This is a tough question to answer because I loved many of my classes. I would have to say the pop culture and media discourse class I took was pretty awesome. The professor was friendly and down to earth which made class discussions super engaging and fun.
### What was your favorite local food or drink? 
The durum kebabs near Norreport and Osterport!
### What was the most important thing that you learned? 
Don’t wait for things to happen. Make things happen!
### How did you interact with the local community and culture? 
I had a visiting host family when I was abroad and they helped me connect with Danish culture. We went out to food markets, music, bars, and even a local soccer match!
### What tips do you have for students interested in going abroad? 
It’s totally normal to feel nervous about going abroad. I know I felt nervous before going but in hindsight it was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Believe in yourself! If you are debating going abroad I would reach out to anyone you know who has been abroad in order to learn more before you make your final decision.
### How did you grow as an individual while studying abroad? 
I became more independent and self-reliant when I went abroad. I think it is sort of inevitable someone becomes more independent when they go abroad, but that’s a good thing. You become more confident in your choices as you go grocery shopping by yourself, navigate a new city by yourself, and travel by yourself.
### What is your most cherished memory of your abroad experience? 
During our version of spring break, I traveled to Amsterdam, Barcelona, and Lisbon with a friend. It was awesome to be able to experience so many different cultures and do so many fun activities in such a short amount of time. By the end we were exhausted but I wouldn’t change a thing.

### Semester or Academic Year
#### Academic Advising for Study Abroad
Students must speak with their academic advisor or academic department regarding semester study abroad or off-campus study. Students should discuss academic matters such as: major/minor requirements, course sequencing, and flexibility of course sequencing. Note that some academic departments have policies, or guidelines regarding which courses can/cannot transfer back to Lafayette. It is the student’s responsibility to understand and remain within those academic parameters.
#### Registering for Abroad Courses
When registering for courses abroad or off-campus students should keep in mind two processes.
Lafayette – In order to have courses transfer back to Lafayette, students will complete the Course Approval Process. This process typically takes place after a student has been accepted to a program. You can learn more about the Course Approval Process here. Students will  _not_ register for courses at Lafayette for the semester they are abroad.
Abroad Program – A student’s abroad program will require them to register for program courses either before they depart or after they are on-site. Please note every program/university has a different course registration process and so the registration process and timeline will most likely look different from what students experience at Lafayette. Students should regularly check program-related e-mails to ensure they are not missing any deadlines or important tasks.
#### Transfer of Credit & Grades
Please be aware that all credits and all grades that students earn on affiliated semester and academic year programs abroad will transfer back to Lafayette.  _There are no exceptions to this rule_. Even if no specific department has “signed off on” or “approved” a course, it will still be counted as general credit toward graduation (although it will not fulfill any specific requirements such as those for a major, minor, or Common Course of Study), and both the credit and the grade will appear on students’ Lafayette transcripts.
Students may not take courses abroad/off-campus for Pass/Fail nor will the Student Affairs Committee allow students to convert letter grades to Pass/Fail retroactively.
Please know that there is sometimes a time lag between the receipt of a student’s grade report from their program and the appearance of those same credits and grades on their Lafayette transcript. In order to minimize this delay, students should request in writing that a transcript copy be sent from the affiliated program to the Office of the Registrar at Lafayette. Copies should be requested prior to completion of the abroad semester by following the guidelines established by the affiliated program. Transcripts should be sent directly to:
Office of the Registrar Lafayette College 001 Markle Hall Easton, PA 18042
Keep in mind that assessment of academic performance in other countries can be different from the grading system used in the US. If a student direct-enrolls in a foreign university, for example, they may find that their entire semester grade is based solely on the final exam or on one midterm and a final. Students may also discover that A’s or their equivalents are much harder to earn; in some countries, it is assumed that merely passing a class is a mark of high achievement.
#### Course Load and Conversion of Credit
The number of transfer credits a student receives at Lafayette is calculated based on the system used by the affiliated US institution that manages the study abroad program. If the program uses a course-based system, then one course abroad will typically transfer as one full credit (one course) at Lafayette. If it is a semester credit-hour system, a 4-credit course is typically equivalent to 1 full Lafayette credit, and a 3-credit course will typically count as 0.80 Lafayette credits (effective fall 2022). Lafayette students are expected to carry a four-course credit load or a 15-16 semester credit-hour load while abroad. If all or most of the courses a student plans to take abroad are 3-credit (semester-hour) courses, the student will have to take 5 courses to carry a full load. Any variations must be approved by the Director of International and Off-Campus Education and the Lafayette Registrar.
### Interim
Each interim course is coded in the course catalog as fulfilling some requirements (e.g., Common Course of Study requirements such as GM1, GM2, LANG, SS, H, NS, etc.; or interdisciplinary program requirements such as Asian Studies, Classical Civilizations, etc.). That information can be found on the Banner catalog, or on the program brochure pages. Please see the Interim Programs page for more information.
### Summer & Interim Study Abroad with Non-Lafayette Programs
Lafayette College students who wish to participate in other summer study abroad programs are free to choose any program they want, provided that the program does not duplicate a program being offered by Lafayette and that they have a department head approve the program and sign off on the “Committee on Academic Progress Off Campus Study Authorization Summer/Interim/Miscellaneous” (the form is available at the Registrar’s office) prior to their application. More information on the Course Approval Process can be found here. If the program is not pre-approved by a department head, the credits may not be accepted by Lafayette. Grades earned on summer study abroad programs do not transfer and will not be factored into a Lafayette student’s GPA.
Summer and Interim study abroad with Non-Lafayette programs is typically a more independent process and students work directly with the program for most matters, including financial payments. The Office of International & Off-Campus Education is available to complete program approval forms for summer study abroad programs granted a student meets the eligibility requirements for summer study abroad.

While nationally women make up 65% of the study abroad population, there are still several concerns females may have regarding studying abroad or off-campus. When traveling internationally, it’s important to remember that women are perceived and treated differently in different cultures. There are differing gender roles, differing perspectives on suitable clothing, differing opinions of what is appropriate and inappropriate attention from men, differences in the cultural norms of friendships and dating, etc. These differences can affect a female student’s study abroad experience, including the expectations women bring into their off-campus study experience; their values, beliefs, and perspectives; and the day-to-day experience a woman might have abroad or off-campus.

### Safety Tips
  * Do not attract undue or unwanted attention to yourself by engaging in behaviors that can mark you as a tourist and thus as a target for pickpockets, etc.
  * Don’t wander around with your face buried in a guidebook or behind a huge map; instead, stop for a moment to consult them in an out-of-the-way spot.
  * Don’t pull large amounts of cash out of your pocket; keep a small amount of cash in one pocket, and if you must carry more, keep it elsewhere on your person.
  * Don’t wear flashy jewelry. Keep expensive cameras in a non-descript carry bag.
  * Don’t yell inappropriately or converse very loudly in public places.
  * Remain aware of your surroundings at all times: Know where you are and where you are going. Don’t travel alone if you can avoid it, and make sure you don’t get separated from your companion(s).
  * To the extent possible, adapt to local standards of dress. If no one else is wearing shorts and flip flops, you shouldn’t either; doing so will make you stand out as a tourist. Note that wearing sneakers and a baseball cap has the same effect in many countries.
  * Be discreet and respectful when taking photographs. If you want to photograph people, ask for their permission first.
  * Carry a list of emergency contact numbers (local and at home) with you at all times.
  * Make sure someone else always knows your travel plans.
  * Wear shoes that are easy to remove for both security screening purposes and for comfort on the flight.
  * Remember TSA restrictions regarding carry-on items, including limitations on liquids and gels (containers of 3 ounces or less, all must fit within a quart-sized Ziplock bag, and each traveler is limited to one such bag).


### Health Tips
  * Familiarize yourself with your program’s health insurance plan and/or the Lafayette international health/safety insurance plan.
  * Have both medical and dental check-ups before you go abroad.
  * Make sure you receive all required vaccinations before you leave. Note that some vaccinations are given in a series of shots administered weeks or months apart, so do not leave this until the last minute. Your program will provide information on necessary vaccinations/medication. You may also consult the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) website.
  * Know what medications are legal/illegal in your destination country. You’d be surprised at what medications other countries either do not allow or for which they have restrictions. This information can be found by connecting with the foreign embassy of your destination country.
  * Obtain enough of all prescription medications that you require for the duration of your program, and make sure to keep them in their original containers with the pharmacy label clearly stating your name and the prescribing doctor’s name. It is also advisable to take a note from your physician stating the medicine you are taking, its dosage, its generic name, and the condition being treated.
  * Make sure you inform your program/program director of any medical conditions for which you might require care or special accommodations while you are abroad (for example diabetes, epilepsy, severe allergies, etc.). Be sure to fully and truthfully complete any medical forms for your program.
  * Know the local conditions that you will encounter while abroad, and consider how this will affect you. Is the weather extreme? Are there common allergens you need to worry about? Does the local diet present any difficulties for you? Is the water safe to drink? Have there been any recent epidemics?
  * As a matter of both health and safety, avoid overindulging in alcohol while abroad, and absolutely refrain from using any illegal drugs.
  * Carry information about blood type, important medical conditions, and any other medical information on your person.


### Disclosure of Medical Conditions and/or Disabilities
The social and cultural changes associated with studying abroad can put students under a great deal of physical and emotional stress, aggravating existing conditions. For this reason, we strongly encourage students to disclose any and all medical, physical, psychological, and/or dietary conditions that may require special accommodation while abroad. Such information will be kept strictly confidential, released only to the Director of the program and any necessary health care professionals should such a need arise.
You can find more information regarding disabilities abroad at http://www.miusa.org
Lafayette College complies with all federal and state legislation and does not in any way discriminate in educational programs on the basis of physical ability.
### Sexual Assault Abroad
If you’ve experienced sexual violence, intimate partner violence, stalking, or other forms of sexual or gender-based harassment, you are likely to have concerns and questions. The below resources are available to you in order to move forward in a way that’s appropriate for you. **If you are experiencing an emergency or need immediate assistance, please call Lafayette Public Safety at 610-330-4444**.

  * To the extent possible, adapt to local standards of dress. If no one else is wearing shorts and flip flops, you shouldn’t either; doing so will make you stand out as a tourist. Note that wearing sneakers and a baseball cap has the same effect in many countries.
  * Be discreet and respectful when taking photographs. If you want to photograph people, ask for their permission first.
  * Carry a list of emergency contact numbers (local and at home) with you at all times.
  * Make sure someone else always knows your travel plans.
  * Wear shoes that are easy to remove for both security screening purposes and for comfort on the flight.
  * Remember TSA restrictions regarding carry-on items, including limitations on liquids and gels (containers of 3 ounces or less, all must fit within a quart-sized Ziplock bag, and each traveler is limited to one such bag).


### Health Tips
  * Familiarize yourself with your program’s health insurance plan and/or the Lafayette international health/safety insurance plan.
  * Have both medical and dental check-ups before you go abroad.
  * Make sure you receive all required vaccinations before you leave. Note that some vaccinations are given in a series of shots administered weeks or months apart, so do not leave this until the last minute. Your program will provide information on necessary vaccinations/medication. You may also consult the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) website.
  * Know what medications are legal/illegal in your destination country. You’d be surprised at what medications other countries either do not allow or for which they have restrictions. This information can be found by connecting with the foreign embassy of your destination country.
  * Obtain enough of all prescription medications that you require for the duration of your program, and make sure to keep them in their original containers with the pharmacy label clearly stating your name and the prescribing doctor’s name. It is also advisable to take a note from your physician stating the medicine you are taking, its dosage, its generic name, and the condition being treated.
  * Make sure you inform your program/program director of any medical conditions for which you might require care or special accommodations while you are abroad (for example diabetes, epilepsy, severe allergies, etc.). Be sure to fully and truthfully complete any medical forms for your program.
  * Know the local conditions that you will encounter while abroad, and consider how this will affect you. Is the weather extreme? Are there common allergens you need to worry about? Does the local diet present any difficulties for you? Is the water safe to drink? Have there been any recent epidemics?
  * As a matter of both health and safety, avoid overindulging in alcohol while abroad, and absolutely refrain from using any illegal drugs.
  * Carry information about blood type, important medical conditions, and any other medical information on your person.


### Disclosure of Medical Conditions and/or Disabilities
The social and cultural changes associated with studying abroad can put students under a great deal of physical and emotional stress, aggravating existing conditions. For this reason, we strongly encourage students to disclose any and all medical, physical, psychological, and/or dietary conditions that may require special accommodation while abroad. Such information will be kept strictly confidential, released only to the Director of the program and any necessary health care professionals should such a need arise.
You can find more information regarding disabilities abroad at http://www.miusa.org
Lafayette College complies with all federal and state legislation and does not in any way discriminate in educational programs on the basis of physical ability.
### Sexual Assault Abroad
If you’ve experienced sexual violence, intimate partner violence, stalking, or other forms of sexual or gender-based harassment, you are likely to have concerns and questions. The below resources are available to you in order to move forward in a way that’s appropriate for you. **If you are experiencing an emergency or need immediate assistance, please call Lafayette Public Safety at 610-330-4444**.

International students at Lafayette are already engaging in a cross-cultural experience right here on campus. But these students also have the opportunity to continue broadening their international horizons by studying abroad for an interim or semester program, or by studying off-campus in one of the US-based programs. International students should start the planning and preparation process early – including working with the Lafayette International Student Advising Office to make sure their US student visa will be up-to-date – as they may encounter different visa regulations than American students. Additionally, international students may find that their relationship to a host culture may be different than the relationship of the Americans on their study abroad/off-campus study program.
Below are some links to help inform and support international students as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help international students prepare for their off-campus study experience. Please also feel free to discuss any questions or concerns with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

By studying abroad/off-campus, LGBTQ+ students have the opportunity to experience their sexual identity and other aspects of their identity from a new cultural perspective. It is important to consider, though, that attitudes and understandings of LGBTQ+ individuals vary by region, country, culture, and individuals abroad. While some countries provide protection and equal rights to LGBTQ+ individuals, others may see identifying openly as an LGBTQ+ individual as punishable by law. It’s important for all students, including LGBTQ+ students, to get to know and understand the host culture’s laws, history, perceptions, and politics before they go abroad/off-campus.

Study abroad students have access to several useful services provided by the Lafayette Library, including access to subscription databases, electronic document delivery, interlibrary loan, research assistance, and country information.
### Country information
Visit the library’s research tools page on Countries & Maps to locate background information on the country where you’ll be living and studying.
### Access to Databases
Lafayette students have access to subscription web-based resources from abroad. Clicking on a link to a subscription research tool (such as Academic Search Premier, JSTOR, or RefWorks) from the Library web site or Library Catalog when you are off-campus will produce a page that prompts you for your Lafayette College Network ID and password. Once you enter the proper credentials, you will be passed directly to the site.
### Document Delivery
Study abroad students can have journal articles and book chapters from Lafayette-owned materials scanned and delivered as PDFs to their Interlibrary Loan accounts. However, since this service is ONLY offered to Lafayette College students studying abroad, the library needs to know who you are. Please email the Interlibrary Loan department at ill@lafayette.edu to alert us of your study abroad status. Once we have identified you as a study abroad student, when logging into the Interlibrary Loan system, you will see a “Document Delivery Request” option from the main page. Requests are usually filled within 24 to 48 hours.
### Interlibrary Loan (ILL)
Study abroad students may submit requests for journal articles and book chapters unavailable in Skillman or Kirby Libraries or in the library at your host institution. Books cannot be requested via ILL while studying abroad. Log in to the ILL system using your Lafayette Network ID and password and use the request forms located there, or send a request directly from the library’s electronic databases, such as Academic Search Premier, Web of Science, and other periodical databases, using the WebBridge feature. Just look for a link to “Lafayette WebBridge” or the WebBridge icon.
### Research Assistance
Send a research question by email to refdesk@lafayette.edu and receive a response within 24 hours. Students preparing to start researching and writing honors theses when they return from abroad are encouraged to communicate early with librarians. In-person appointments can be arranged via our online form in advance of your return to campus.
### Research Guides
The library has also created a number of guides to help students navigate various stages of the research process. Guides are available for: finding articles; identifying and evaluating primary sources; assessing information sources such as articles and websites; citing articles and web pages; and many other topics.

### How much spending money will you need?
Although this really depends on your personal spending habits and your destination country, you will probably spend more money while studying abroad than you would during the same period at home. Common expenses include eating out, souvenirs/gifts, and—the biggest category—personal travel. The best advice is to talk with other students who have been on your program, and ask them what they tended to spend money on, and then make a personal budget for yourself.
### Your bank 
Let your bank know where you’re going. This includes your destination country, any layover airports, and any countries you plan to travel to while living abroad. If you don’t, your bank may assume your account has been compromised and may freeze your accounts.
### ATMs 
When traveling, debit cards are very convenient: ATMs are generally accessible 24/7, they make it unnecessary to carry large amounts of cash, and the money you receive from an ATM will be in the local currency. Check with the bank that issues your card, however, to learn if/how much they charge for “foreign transaction fees” which can vary greatly from bank to bank. There may also be “external ATM fees” for not using your bank’s ATMs. Check with your bank to see if they have sister banks abroad to avoid the external ATM fees.
### Credit cards 
Taking a credit card can be a good idea in case you have to make a purchase that exceeds the daily limit of your debit card. Credit card may also carry “foreign transaction fees” which can vary greatly from bank to bank.
### Contact info 
Make sure to have a list of customer service numbers to call in case any of your credit cards are stolen—you will want to cancel them immediately. Leave this list with your parents as well, since it may be easier for them to make the calls from the U.S. than for you to do so from abroad.
### Emergency fund 
Take an emergency fund in cash (at least $100) when you are traveling; keep it securely stored in a neck pouch or money belt. It is better to take small bills (10s or 20s).
### Bills back home 
If you will be responsible for paying bills in the U.S. while you are abroad, set up automatic debit or online payment options (through your bank, an online service, or the institutions you have to pay) before you leave.

URL: https://studyabroad.lafayette.edu/additional-resources/packing/#page

### Pack light 
Do not overpack. Lugging huge, heavy bags through airports, train stations, and city streets is exhausting and inconvenient, and may place you as a tourist target. Use website resources like OneBag.com to learn the “art and science” of traveling light.
### Baggage allowances 
Consult the webpage of the specific airline you will use and determine the size and weight limitations for luggage on international flights (which can be different from the limitations for domestic flights) as well as for the number of checked and carry-on bags they allow. If you exceed these limits, you will have to pay a substantial surcharge.
### Your carry-on 
Your carry-on should be used to pack essential items – things you can’t live without in the event that your checked bag is lost in transit. This will include your passport, arrival information for your program, medical information, prescription medication, eyeglasses, valuable items, and enough clothing for a few days.
### Your passport 
Your passport should be packed in your carry-on bag or onboard personal item. Pack a copy of your passport (picture, personal information page, and visa) in all of your checked bags and in your carry-on. You may also leave a copy at home with your parent/guardian.
### Identify your bag 
Make sure you have clear identification on both the outside (luggage tag) and inside of each bag you take. A distinctive marker on the outside of your bag (a large sticker, colorful strap, etc.) will help you identify it easily while traveling.
### Pack an empty bag 
You may wish to pack an empty duffel bag which can lay flat near the top of your suitcase. It works well if you end up buying souvenirs, gifts, etc. and need an extra bag for the additional items for your flight home.
### Buy stuff abroad 
Many items you might think to pack can actually be purchased abroad, such as: toiletries, batteries, notebooks, office supplies, sunscreen, etc. You may wish to pack a travel-size amount of toiletries to get you through the first few days. If you are very specific about brands, ingredients, etc., you should check to make sure those items are available abroad.
### Adapters/converters 
If taking electronic equipment, make sure you have the required adapters (to fit the local outlets) and/or voltage converters. It’s recommended that you leave your low-end electronics (hair dryers/straighteners, electric shavers, etc.) at home and purchase new ones abroad as low-end electronics are more likely to fry than high-end electronics (i.e. laptops, smart phones, which can typically account for a larger range of voltage). Low-end electronics are typically cheap enough to purchase new abroad and you may wish to go in on them with your abroad roommates to ease the cost. Use website resources like WorldStandards to get more information on adapters and converters needed for your destination country.
### Clothing 
Take into consideration your destination’s climate as well as the typical standard of dress—students who have been on your program before can help you with this information. Know that most students pack far too much—remember that you may buy clothes while abroad. Take clothes that you can layer, and if you plan to do a lot of traveling, take durable, drip-dry, no-iron clothes. Definitely take comfortable walking shoes.
### Miscellaneous items you might want to take 
Travel alarm clock, sunglasses, umbrella, small backpack for school books or short trips (could serve as your carry-on too), money belt, and guide book for your country or city. If you plan to travel independently and stay in hostels, a travel sheet (a lightweight silk or nylon bag) and a lightweight travel towel are good investments.

When studying abroad/off-campus, students may find that host cultures may have completely different sets of beliefs and customs or may approach similar beliefs in a different way. Studying abroad in a country that has a different religious majority than what students are accustomed to can be challenging, but can also be an opportunity to broaden their perspectives and to connect across spiritual boundaries.

Student-Athletes make great study abroad participants. Already well-versed in organization, flexibility, and perseverance, student-athletes have already honed many of the skills needed to have a successful and enjoyable study abroad experience. Student-athletes will face some challenges, though. Timing a study abroad experience among athletic, academic, and social commitments can be tricky. Additionally, keeping up with a workout regimen and athletic skills while studying abroad takes preparation. It’s important for student-athletes to speak to their coaches, student-athlete support services through the Academic Resource Hub (formerly known as ATTIC), academic advisor, and the Office of International & Off-Campus Education to find the best time and location to go abroad, to talk about NCAA compliance and eligibility, and to prepare for academic, athletic, and personal needs while abroad. With planning, student-athletes can have a successful international experience and can utilize their athletic skills to take advantage of sport-related cultural immersion opportunities while abroad.

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students are studying abroad at rapidly increasing numbers. Even so, some students will encounter challenges when planning and preparing for an international experience. For STEM students, it’s important to begin the planning process early, especially when it comes to academics. Students should continuously speak with their academic advisers about the courses they should take on-campus before they go abroad, when the best time is for them to go abroad, and what courses they should look for while abroad. It’s also important to keep in mind that academics vary greatly in different countries. Course demands may be higher, support services may be less available, and teaching styles will vary. This is all part of the cultural experience and students should be prepared to display flexibility and perseverance in their academic lives abroad. Students can work with both the Office of International & Off-Campus Education and their academic department/adviser to plan for their time abroad.
Below are some links to help inform and support STEM students as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help STEM students prepare for their off-campus study experience. Please also feel free to discuss any questions or concerns with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

Students with disabilities is a broad term that can encompass a wide variety of challenges that students face in their everyday lives. Whether a student is living with a physical impairment, structured mental health management, or is in need of academic support services, these students will need to prepare to continue managing these aspects of their lives while abroad. It is important that students work with the Academic Resource Hub (formerly known as ATTIC), the College Counseling Center, the Office of International & Off-Campus Education, and the host institution abroad to collect and communicate information and to arrange appropriate support abroad. Early planning is encouraged and often necessary as the host institution abroad may have to take several steps in order to prepare to adequately support a student with a disability. It’s also important to keep in mind that every culture views disability differently in their perceptions, norms, and laws. Some study abroad locations will offer more adequate support services than others. The good news is that, for many students with a disability, skills like flexibility and perseverance are already highly developed and will be helpful when adapting to a new place and culture.

While Lafayette College encourages all students, faculty, and staff to engage in off-campus activities, including study abroad, internships, research, volunteer activities, and music performances or sports competitions in various countries, the College is also concerned with the safety of its constituents. The following policy provides guidance on how Lafayette College evaluates its sponsored activities in high-risk destinations. This may include countries where the US State Department has issued a level 3 or level 4 travel advisory, as well as countries without a Travel advisory that still pose a significant threat to the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff, and to the running of the program.
### Risk Assessment Committee for Off-Campus Studies
The Risk Assessment Committee for Off-Campus Studies exists to assess the risks of any off-campus program that may, for any reason, appear to present significant concerns for the safety and well-being of the participants.
The committee shall consist of the Dean of the Faculty, the College’s Risk Manager, the College’s Legal Counsel, the Director of International & Off-Campus Education, and a faculty member of the Off-Campus Studies Advisory Committee. The committee may consult with other members of the campus community with expertise pertinent to specific situations. Recommendations of the committee regarding a change in status of a program will be made to the Provost, who will have the sole authority for the final decision to continue or discontinue the program.
### Procedure
An evaluation by the Risk Assessment Committee for Off-Campus Studies will generally be initiated by level 3 or 4 travel advisories issued by the U.S. State Department. Additionally, members of the campus community can petition the committee to conduct an evaluation. Any recommendations on changing the status of a program will be made to the Provost, who will have the sole authority for the final decision.
If a program/trip is targeting a high-risk country, students and/or their faculty or staff advisers may be invited to participate in a risk assessment meeting. Prior to the meeting, a pre-departure report may be requested, and during or after the meeting additional information and waiver of responsibility forms may be required. Please note that, if a student or group is planning to travel to a high-risk country, the risk assessment evaluation and procedure must start at least two months before the scheduled departure so as to allow enough time to review the case. Failure do so may cause a delay in program approval, which may make it necessary for the student or group to postpone the scheduled program.
Level 3 or 4 travel advisories containing the following designations will automatically cause the College to cancel its sponsorship of an activity:
  1. orders for departure of US dependents and non-emergency personnel;
  2. departure recommendations for any US citizens remaining in the country after the initial order for US dependents and non-emergency personnel to depart;
  3. strong warnings to US citizens against travel to the country; and
  4. warnings to US citizens to defer (nonessential) travel to the country.


To learn more about the risk assessment process or to get started with the risk assessment process, please contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.
### How to Petition for a Risk Assessment
Any member of the campus community who is concerned that the College is sponsoring a program in a destination that exposes Lafayette students, faculty, and/or staff to an inordinate level of risk may submit a written petition for assessment of the program to the Director of International & Off-Campus Education, who will then forward the petition to the committee. The petition should explain the factors contributing to the perception of inordinate risk and should include appropriate documentation of these factors (government reports or warnings, news reports, etc.).
### Refunds
When Lafayette College officially suspends travel prior to the commencement of a program or activity abroad, the student shall be entitled to a full refund of all monies paid to date related to that program, excluding any nonrefundable deposits. Should Lafayette College suspend an international program while it is in progress, every effort will be made by the College to evacuate participants in the program. Any unexpended funds or refunds received from canceled activities will be returned to the student.
Students who voluntarily withdraw from a program where Lafayette College has not officially suspended the program will be responsible for all unrecoverable costs incurred to the date of withdrawal, as well as any nonrefundable deposits that were made.

Historically, students of color have been underrepresented in the study abroad experience. However, the number of students of color participating in study abroad is increasing. In addition to general questions about study abroad, students of color may wonder how they will be perceived abroad. It is important to remember that every country’s culture, attitudes, and norms are different, and that, even within a country, different regions (i.e. urban vs. rural) will vary in perspective. As well, some students may find that their nationality may take precedence over ethnic or racial identification in terms of host country perception. As with any aspect of a student’s experience, it’s also important to keep in mind that each individual will have a unique experience.
Below are some links to help inform and support students of color as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help students of color prepare for their off-campus study experience.

### Mandatory Program-Specific Advising
The Office of International & Off-Campus Education requires each semester-long affiliated study abroad student to complete an advising session. This session can be scheduled online under the “Staff” section of the website. Prior to this one-on-one meeting, students should have attended a Get Started Session, researched possible study abroad programs, and developed a list of program “must haves”. One-on-one advising meetings are most successful when students have done some research, and have at least a baseline understanding of the type of experience they hope to have while abroad.
Regardless of this advising requirement, it remains the student’s ultimate responsibility to research and select an appropriate study abroad program, with the support of the Office of International & Off-Campus Education and the student’s academic department(s).
### Initial Academic Advising for Study Abroad
The Office of International & Off-Campus Education encourages students to meet with their academic advisers from the beginning of the study abroad planning process. Specific to semester study abroad, students should speak with their academic advisers about their major/minor requirements, course sequencing, and flexibility of course sequencing. This will help give students an idea of when they should study abroad and what courses they should be/should not be seeking.
Following the mandatory advising meeting with International & Off-Campus Education, students should be prepared to provide academic advisers with the information needed to assess programs or courses (including syllabi, accreditation information, etc.). Students are instructed to speak with their academic adviser/academic department about the appropriateness of courses on any given study abroad program. All other information and questions (i.e. application process, housing options, program dates, deadlines, etc.) should be directed to the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

### About the Bergh Family Fellows Program
In 2022, president and CEO of Levi Strauss & Co. **Chip Bergh ’79 H’22** and his wife, **Juliet** , contributed a $5.25 million gift to Lafayette to support internships, global engagement, and research experiences for 1,000 students across the next five years (200 students per year).
Every year, hundreds of students engage in numerous research, internship, and study abroad opportunities at Lafayette. However, student participation in many of these experiences can often be limited by financial resources. The Bergh Family Fellows (BFF) program addresses this critical need by providing resources in the form of $5,000 fellowships for 200 students every year to pursue those opportunities. Lafayette is currently fundraising to endow this program in perpetuity.
Eligible students who enroll in a Lafayette **faculty-led** winter or summer off-campus study program are **automatically** **considered** for the Bergh Family Fellows Program by the Office of Financial Aid. Students who are applying to an **external** winter or summer program may apply for funding consideration, provided they meet the eligibility requirements, and if funding remains after aid has been distributed to our Lafayette-run programs.
## About Chip Bergh ’79 H’22
Bergh earned a B.A. in international affairs at Lafayette. He continues to maintain a close connection with his alma mater. In 2017, Bergh returned to the College’s campus to deliver a lecture on leadership. In 2019, he generously provided a gift that helped establish the Bradbury Dyer III ’64 Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship’s Bergh Startup Accelerator Program at the College, a 10-week program that provides students with the tools and resources they need to develop and launch their startup ventures.

URL: https://studyabroad.lafayette.edu/cultural-adjustment/#page

When studying abroad for any period of time, you may go through an adjustment process. In your new international or domestic location you will face a new cultural, academic, political, and environmental setting. You may encounter new ways of thinking that excite and inspire you, and you may also encounter situations and ideas that challenge and frustrate you.
Many students will go through what study abroad professionals refer to as the Cultural Adjustment Curve, shown below. As you look at the curve and move through the process, it is important to note that not all students will engage with the process in the same way. You may skip certain stages, experience the process in a different order, or you may encounter shorter or longer adjustment periods than other students.
It’s important for you to identify your feelings—both positive and negative—during your time abroad and to reflect on these feelings. It’s also important to know that you are not alone in these feelings and that you have resources to connect to both on-site and through Lafayette College. Below are resources available to all Lafayette students studying off-campus.
  * On-site program leaders or administration: Your on-site leaders and program administrators are a good place to start when looking for support during an off-campus or abroad program. They can help point you in the right direction for the resources you need.
  * Medical Insurance Provider: All students are covered by either their affiliated program’s medical insurance or by Lafayette’s On Call International plan. Your medical insurance provider is a good place to look for referrals to local counseling services and mental health professionals.


### The 5 Rs of Culture Change
The 5 Rs of Culture Change is a more recent cultural adjustment model that identifies five key changes (routines, reactions, roles, relationships and reflections about yourself) we face when we move across cultures. It helps us understand  _why_ it is normal to experience ups and downs when moving across cultures and  _why_ stress is a part of the transition process.
Expand All Collapse All
### Routines 
When we first move across cultures many of our routines are disrupted: we eat different foods at different times of the day, we have to navigate a new environment, and we may be without a regular schedule for some time as we get settled. At the same time, even the most basic of routines, from turning on lights, to getting on a bus, to shopping at the grocery store – which we normally do on auto-pilot without much thinking, may suddenly require more (and in some cases our full) focus and energy.
### Reactions 
We do things we are accustomed to doing in our own culture – but we get a very different reaction than we expect in our new culture. While we recognize we probably acted out of the norm for the culture we are in, we don’t have the “key” to unlock this situation and understand exactly why people reacted the way they did. At the same time, we experience a different way of working, interacting or engaging. We ourselves try to react appropriately but find ourselves lacking the appropriate skills to do so effectively, be it a command of the language or the ability to shift styles.
### Roles 
We often experience changes in our roles and responsibilities when we move across cultures. We may carry out the same role but in another culture. We may take on a new or expanded role. We may lose roles that are important to us. We find some roles do not change, but our ability to fulfill these roles does. Additionally, others may see us as playing a particular role, whether or not we define ourselves in this way (e.g. the role of “a foreigner” or as a representative of your home culture). We are likely to experience many forms of role changes, sometimes simultaneously.
### Relationships 
When we move to another culture we discover how to live out our relationships in a new environment and are often challenged not to let the stresses around us enter into these relationships. Our relationships with those we transition with may get stronger, deeper and more profound as a result of going through the change, but they also take work. At the same time, we find other relationships around us changing—we may drift apart from certain friendships back home, be surprised at the newfound sense of closeness and kinship we experience with others despite the distance, and be challenged to recreate relationships in our new environment so we have a sense of community and support.
###  Reflections About Yourself 
As we experience culture change, we may start to notice that we ourselves change in some subtle and not so subtle ways: we may realize we actually really enjoy certain aspects of the lifestyle abroad that we didn’t know we would; or, we realize just how important certain values are to us that we might not have articulated before. We may pick up certain habits, gestures, and ways of being that are now natural to us, but also may surprise and disarm family and friends back home who start to wonder what else has changed about us. We are growing, evolving, and developing—trying to become more aware of who we are culturally and individually speaking—which brings many benefits but often also some confusion and uncertainty.

We are growing, evolving, and developing—trying to become more aware of who we are culturally and individually speaking—which brings many benefits but often also some confusion and uncertainty.
Kate Berardo, “Framework: The 5Rs of Culture Change,” in  _Building Cultural Competence: Innovative Activities and Models_ , eds. K. Berardo and D. K. Deardorff (Sterling, VA: Stylus, 2012), 193-199.

### Tips to Prepare You for Your Host Culture/Destination
You’ve picked a program, filled out the necessary paperwork, and sat through Pre-Departure Orientation. But you still don’t feel ready! That’s okay—there will be a lot of new things to learn once you’re at your off-campus destination. Before you go, though, there’s tons you can do to prepare yourself and to help you get excited about your upcoming experience. Below are 7 ways you can prepare for what’s up ahead.
Expand All Collapse All
### Utilize the library’s resources 
The Lafayette College Library website provides tons of resources for getting to know your target location and culture before you arrive at your destination. Visit the library website to start exploring.
### Utilize the U.S. Department of State website 
The U.S. Department of State provides country-specific information that may be especially relevant to U.S. citizens. You can learn about safety and health information, in-country transportation options, and the laws and regulations of your destination on the State Department’s website.
### Learn what’s up with culture 
No matter where you’re going, it’s important to be culturally prepared. The What’s Up With Culture website tells you what culture is, why it’s different around the world, and how you can prepare yourself to be open to the differences and challenges you’ll face in your new host culture.
### Study the language before you arrive 
If you’re going to a non-English-speaking country, you’ll probably take courses in the host country’s language once you arrive at your destination. But it doesn’t hurt to start learning some words beforehand. In fact, it can help you to adapt faster, connect with locals, and succeed in your classes.
The best way to learn a new language before you go abroad is with formal instruction on Lafayette’s campus. Lafayette offers a variety of language options in our Languages and Literary Studies department. Visit the LLS website to learn about the language courses offered at Lafayette.
If you don’t have time in your schedule for another language class or your target language isn’t offered on-campus, you can also utilize Lafayette’s Language Library or other free online resources to help you begin learning the language. Below we provide 3 free options for you, but feel free to explore the internet for more resources:
  * Lafayette Language Library is located on the 4th floor of Pardee Hall.
  * Duolingo lets you learn a language while playing games.
  * BBC Languages provides basic phrases in various languages.


### Read local newspapers 
Reading the local news from your destination in either English or in the target language lets you know what’s going on in your target location, and what’s important to the people there, and helps you be prepared to discuss events and politics with the locals.
### Read fiction and non-fiction books 
In addition to the local news, fiction and non-fiction reading about your target location and by writers from your target location lets you get to know the culture and country further.
### Watch movies and television shows 
Use movies/TV shows set in and about your host culture and country to get a better feel for the place. Just note that not all television is created equal. Look for high-quality movies and shows that help you begin to understand the intricacies of your host culture and that don’t generalize or make fun of your host culture.

While nationally women make up 65% of the study abroad population, there are still several concerns females may have regarding studying abroad or off-campus. When traveling internationally, it’s important to remember that women are perceived and treated differently in different cultures. There are differing gender roles, differing perspectives on suitable clothing, differing opinions of what is appropriate and inappropriate attention from men, differences in the cultural norms of friendships and dating, etc. These differences can affect a female student’s study abroad experience, including the expectations women bring into their off-campus study experience; their values, beliefs, and perspectives; and the day-to-day experience a woman might have abroad or off-campus.
Below are some links to help inform and support female students as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help female students prepare for their off-campus study experience. Please also feel free to discuss any questions or concerns with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

Credit-bearing programs may be led by Lafayette faculty (both semester-long and short-term) or offered through affiliated partners (e.g., Boston University, Temple University, Syracuse University, IFSA Butler, IES, SIT, CIEE, etc.). Lafayette offers study abroad programs in over 50 countries and through over 30 partner institutions.
### Academic Focus 
We encourage students to consider their academic interests before considering program locations. While there are programs offered in over 50 countries, some programs are better suited for specific majors.
### Language of Instruction 
While you don’t always need a language background to study in a particular location (many programs in non-English-speaking countries offered courses in English), you may wish to consider if learning or improving a language is important to you, your academics, or your future career goals.
### Duration 
Your options include semester(s), full academic year, an interim term in January or May/summer, or interim/summer external programs.
### Location 
Programs exist in Africa, Asia, Europe, Australia and the Pacific, and throughout the Americas. Some locations are better suited for specific majors. Participation in programs in countries with a Department of State level 3 or 4 travel advisory is subject to a petition process through the International Risk Committee.
### Cost 
Program costs and financial models vary and the Office of International & Off-Campus Education can help guide you through the various cost breakdowns. You may also wish to visit the Financial Planning page for further information.
## Types of Programs
### Semester Faculty-Led Programs
### Semester Affiliated Programs
### Lafayette Interim and Summer Programs
### External Winter and Summer Programs

### Semester or Academic Year
#### Academic Advising for Study Abroad
Students must speak with their academic advisor or academic department regarding semester study abroad or off-campus study. Students should discuss academic matters such as: major/minor requirements, course sequencing, and flexibility of course sequencing. Note that some academic departments have policies, or guidelines regarding which courses can/cannot transfer back to Lafayette. It is the student’s responsibility to understand and remain within those academic parameters.
#### Registering for Abroad Courses
When registering for courses abroad or off-campus students should keep in mind two processes.
Lafayette – In order to have courses transfer back to Lafayette, students will complete the Course Approval Process. This process typically takes place after a student has been accepted to a program. You can learn more about the Course Approval Process here. Students will  _not_ register for courses at Lafayette for the semester they are abroad.
Abroad Program – A student’s abroad program will require them to register for program courses either before they depart or after they are on-site. Please note every program/university has a different course registration process and so the registration process and timeline will most likely look different from what students experience at Lafayette. Students should regularly check program-related e-mails to ensure they are not missing any deadlines or important tasks.
#### Transfer of Credit & Grades
Please be aware that all credits and all grades that students earn on affiliated semester and academic year programs abroad will transfer back to Lafayette.  _There are no exceptions to this rule_. Even if no specific department has “signed off on” or “approved” a course, it will still be counted as general credit toward graduation (although it will not fulfill any specific requirements such as those for a major, minor, or Common Course of Study), and both the credit and the grade will appear on students’ Lafayette transcripts.
Students may not take courses abroad/off-campus for Pass/Fail nor will the Student Affairs Committee allow students to convert letter grades to Pass/Fail retroactively.
Please know that there is sometimes a time lag between the receipt of a student’s grade report from their program and the appearance of those same credits and grades on their Lafayette transcript. In order to minimize this delay, students should request in writing that a transcript copy be sent from the affiliated program to the Office of the Registrar at Lafayette. Copies should be requested prior to completion of the abroad semester by following the guidelines established by the affiliated program. Transcripts should be sent directly to:
Office of the Registrar Lafayette College 001 Markle Hall Easton, PA 18042
Keep in mind that assessment of academic performance in other countries can be different from the grading system used in the US. If a student direct-enrolls in a foreign university, for example, they may find that their entire semester grade is based solely on the final exam or on one midterm and a final. Students may also discover that A’s or their equivalents are much harder to earn; in some countries, it is assumed that merely passing a class is a mark of high achievement.
#### Course Load and Conversion of Credit
The number of transfer credits a student receives at Lafayette is calculated based on the system used by the affiliated US institution that manages the study abroad program. If the program uses a course-based system, then one course abroad will typically transfer as one full credit (one course) at Lafayette. If it is a semester credit-hour system, a 4-credit course is typically equivalent to 1 full Lafayette credit, and a 3-credit course will typically count as 0.80 Lafayette credits (effective fall 2022). Lafayette students are expected to carry a four-course credit load or a 15-16 semester credit-hour load while abroad. If all or most of the courses a student plans to take abroad are 3-credit (semester-hour) courses, the student will have to take 5 courses to carry a full load. Any variations must be approved by the Director of International and Off-Campus Education and the Lafayette Registrar.
### Interim
Each interim course is coded in the course catalog as fulfilling some requirements (e.g., Common Course of Study requirements such as GM1, GM2, LANG, SS, H, NS, etc.; or interdisciplinary program requirements such as Asian Studies, Classical Civilizations, etc.). That information can be found on the Banner catalog, or on the program brochure pages. Please see the Interim Programs page for more information.
### Summer & Interim Study Abroad with Non-Lafayette Programs
Lafayette College students who wish to participate in other summer study abroad programs are free to choose any program they want, provided that the program does not duplicate a program being offered by Lafayette and that they have a department head approve the program and sign off on the “Committee on Academic Progress Off Campus Study Authorization Summer/Interim/Miscellaneous” (the form is available at the Registrar’s office) prior to their application. More information on the Course Approval Process can be found here. If the program is not pre-approved by a department head, the credits may not be accepted by Lafayette. Grades earned on summer study abroad programs do not transfer and will not be factored into a Lafayette student’s GPA.
Summer and Interim study abroad with Non-Lafayette programs is typically a more independent process and students work directly with the program for most matters, including financial payments. The Office of International & Off-Campus Education is available to complete program approval forms for summer study abroad programs granted a student meets the eligibility requirements for summer study abroad.

### Mandatory Program-Specific Advising
The Office of International & Off-Campus Education requires each semester-long affiliated study abroad student to complete an advising session. This session can be scheduled online under the “Staff” section of the website. Prior to this one-on-one meeting, students should have attended a Get Started Session, researched possible study abroad programs, and developed a list of program “must haves”. One-on-one advising meetings are most successful when students have done some research, and have at least a baseline understanding of the type of experience they hope to have while abroad.
Regardless of this advising requirement, it remains the student’s ultimate responsibility to research and select an appropriate study abroad program, with the support of the Office of International & Off-Campus Education and the student’s academic department(s).
### Initial Academic Advising for Study Abroad
The Office of International & Off-Campus Education encourages students to meet with their academic advisers from the beginning of the study abroad planning process. Specific to semester study abroad, students should speak with their academic advisers about their major/minor requirements, course sequencing, and flexibility of course sequencing. This will help give students an idea of when they should study abroad and what courses they should be/should not be seeking.
Following the mandatory advising meeting with International & Off-Campus Education, students should be prepared to provide academic advisers with the information needed to assess programs or courses (including syllabi, accreditation information, etc.). Students are instructed to speak with their academic adviser/academic department about the appropriateness of courses on any given study abroad program. All other information and questions (i.e. application process, housing options, program dates, deadlines, etc.) should be directed to the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

Lafayette College does not maintain a list of pre-approved or affiliated programs for winter and summer interim study abroad. Students may select from the wide range of programs available, provided that the program:
  * does not duplicate a program being offered by Lafayette during that term, 
  * offers a US transcript or has a US School of Record,
  * and has Lafayette academic advisor and department head approval on the transfer credit petition form prior to their application. More information on the course approval process can be found here. If participation is not pre-approved by a department head, Lafayette may not accept the credits.


Grades earned on external winter and summer programs are not recorded, however, transfer credit may be applied. Review the full transfer policy here.
Winter and summer study abroad with non-Lafayette programs is typically a more independent process and students work directly with the program for most matters, including financial payments. For the most part, students will have program approval forms completed through the Registrar’s Office.
Eligible students in an external abroad program may apply for funding through the Bergh Family Fund, provided they meet the eligibility requirements.
In addition to the requirements outlined above, there are a few things that students should consider when selecting a summer or winter external program:
  * What is the program calendar? Do the program’s start/end dates conflict with my personal plans, internships, or Lafayette courses? Students are typically not allowed to arrive late or leave programs early in order to accommodate these things.
  * What’s included in the costs of the program? Some programs, but not all, include things like excursions, housing, meals, airfare, and insurance. It’s important to understand which costs you would pay to the program and which you would need to budget for.
  * Does the program offer international insurance? What does it cover?
  * Are there any prerequisites, such as a language requirement?
  * What is the language of instruction?
  * What type of housing is provided?

  * Applicants cannot register for a Lafayette faculty-led interim program in the same term.
  * Program duration should be at least 17 days on-site.


### How do I find an external winter and summer abroad program? 
Lafayette does not maintain a list of pre-approved or affiliated winter and summer abroad programs. As a result, the process for external programs is largely independent. Any external program must meet the following requirements to receive Lafayette credit:
  * The external program does not duplicate a Lafayette faculty-led program offered during the same term.
  * The external program offers a U.S. transcript or has a U.S. School of Record.
  * The student has the Registrar’s approval for transfer credit.


### Application Procedure 
In order to be considered for funding, students must:
  * Meet the eligibility requirements outlined above.
  * Complete the application through the study abroad portal by the deadline (late applications will only be considered on a funding-available basis).
  * Contact Rochelle Keesler (keeslerr@lafayette.edu) to inquire about funding availability.


Successful applicants will be notified of their award by the Office of International and Off-Campus Education and will be required to complete additional steps in order to receive their award.

### Financial Aid
2024-25 Interim Financial Aid Info
Eligible students will be automatically considered for the Bergh Family Fellows Program by the Office of Financial Aid.
### How do I register? 
Please also review the step-by-step registration instructions in the Registration section.
Off-campus interim program registration occurs on the Banner Self-Service system (like registration for any other course). It is a first-come, first-served system and opens at 7:30 am for all students. Students should resolve any account holds prior to registration day. Please see the Important Dates section for this year’s interim registration date.
Students can only register for**one program per interim time period** (i.e. one winter interim program and one May/summer interim program). Students may not register for one program and join the waitlist for another program occurring during the same time period. This means once a student has enrolled in a specific off-campus interim program, they will not have the opportunity to switch to another program.
Students who successfully register in Banner for an interim program must complete their study abroad portal application (instructions will be sent within two business days of registration), which includes a **nonrefundable deposit of $500**. The deadline for submitting these items is listed above in the Important Dates section.
Successful online registration holds a space for a student in a program, but it is not a confirmation of enrollment. To finalize enrollment, students must have a clear disciplinary record (see eligibility page for further information) and complete their study abroad portal application, which includes a $500 nonrefundable deposit. No exceptions can be made to this policy and a spot will not be guaranteed unless these requirements are met by the stated deadline.
If a student successfully registers for an off-campus interim program and is no longer able to or interested in participating, they must notify the office **in writing** by emailing studyabroad@lafayette.edu. Withdrawing after confirming participation in the program by submitting the program deposit will cause the student to incur any non-recoverable costs that the program places in the student’s name.
### What if the program is closed or full? 
If all of the off-campus interim programs that interest a student are closed or full, students should complete a . It is important that students fill out **all** of the information requested to the best of their ability, or else they may not be eligible for waitlist selection.
Students will be moved from the waitlist into programs as space becomes available. Students who indicate an interest in more than one program will be moved into the first program with space. The selected student will be contacted by IOCE about completing their study abroad portal requirements, which includes a $500 nonrefundable deposit. Failure to complete these steps will cause the student to forfeit the space in the program.
Students, parents, etc. should not contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education to ask where the student is on the waitlist. IOCE will contact the student if or when a space is available to them.
### Is it too late to withdraw? 
Students who would like to withdraw from an off-campus interim program must withdraw **in writing** by emailing studyabroad@lafayette.edu. Any student who withdraws from a program, regardless of the reason, after submitting the deposit will forfeit the $500 nonrefundable deposit and will be responsible for any other unrecoverable costs for the program (i.e. airfare, hotel, individual shares of group expenses, etc.), which will be applied to the student’s billing account.
Optional trip cancellation insurance is available. Students will receive further information on CFAR (cancel for any reason) insurance in their study abroad portals after registering.
Note that students whose participation in an off-campus interim program is terminated by Lafayette College for reasons of misconduct will receive neither credit nor refund, will be required to return to the United States immediately, and will bear all expenses related to the changes in the itinerary.
### What will it cost? 
Lafayette College is committed to trying to maintain the cost of off-campus interim programs to make them as affordable as possible. On average, one-credit programs cost around $6800. That amount typically covers tuition, airfare, accommodations, on-site program-related transportation, admission fees to program-sponsored activities, and Lafayette’s overseas health and safety insurance plan. Please see the individual program info pages (linked above in the Programs section) for individual program costs.
### Is financial aid available? 
For Lafayette-led winter and summer off-campus programs, every student who has successfully registered for a winter or summer program will be considered for interim grant eligibility. There is no separate application. A limited amount of financial support is available. Interim grants may range from a minimum of $1,000 up to a maximum of the specific program costs. Interim grant amounts offered will be determined based on the specific program’s costs, level of need, remaining loan eligibility, and the number of eligible registrants. Due to limited funds, students will only be considered if they meet **all** of the following criteria:
  * Currently receive institutional need-based aid in the form of Lafayette College grant assistance.
  * Register during the online registration window in Banner for a winter/summer abroad program. Students who register outside the window will be considered for aid if funding is still available.


The Office of Financial Aid will only send email notifications to students who are awarded an interim grant, indicating their specific grant amount, prior to the interim nonrefundable deposit deadline.
Funding notifications are made by the Office of Financial Aid (please see the Important Dates section above for further details on timing). There is one limited pool of aid for winter and summer interim. Students interested in summer programs should register on the registration date in September in order to ensure consideration for the funding pool. Only students who are awarded funding will be notified.
Eligible students are also encouraged to apply for the Fund for Education Abroad and the Gilman Scholarship.
### Insurance 
Students enrolled in a Lafayette College off-campus interim program occurring outside the United States are automatically enrolled in the College’s overseas health and safety insurance plan. Students enrolled in a Lafayette College off-campus interim program occurring within the United States should continue to use the health insurance program in which they are already enrolled.
Optional trip cancellation insurance is available. Students will receive further information on CFAR (cancel for any reason) insurance in their study abroad portals after registering.

Students, parents, etc. should not contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education to ask where the student is on the waitlist. IOCE will contact the student if or when a space is available to them.
### Is it too late to withdraw? 
Students who would like to withdraw from an off-campus interim program must withdraw **in writing** by emailing studyabroad@lafayette.edu. Any student who withdraws from a program, regardless of the reason, after submitting the deposit will forfeit the $500 nonrefundable deposit and will be responsible for any other unrecoverable costs for the program (i.e. airfare, hotel, individual shares of group expenses, etc.), which will be applied to the student’s billing account.
Optional trip cancellation insurance is available. Students will receive further information on CFAR (cancel for any reason) insurance in their study abroad portals after registering.
Note that students whose participation in an off-campus interim program is terminated by Lafayette College for reasons of misconduct will receive neither credit nor refund, will be required to return to the United States immediately, and will bear all expenses related to the changes in the itinerary.
### What will it cost? 
Lafayette College is committed to trying to maintain the cost of off-campus interim programs to make them as affordable as possible. On average, one-credit programs cost around $6800. That amount typically covers tuition, airfare, accommodations, on-site program-related transportation, admission fees to program-sponsored activities, and Lafayette’s overseas health and safety insurance plan. Please see the individual program info pages (linked above in the Programs section) for individual program costs.
### Is financial aid available? 
For Lafayette-led winter and summer off-campus programs, every student who has successfully registered for a winter or summer program will be considered for interim grant eligibility. There is no separate application. A limited amount of financial support is available. Interim grants may range from a minimum of $1,000 up to a maximum of the specific program costs. Interim grant amounts offered will be determined based on the specific program’s costs, level of need, remaining loan eligibility, and the number of eligible registrants. Due to limited funds, students will only be considered if they meet **all** of the following criteria:
  * Currently receive institutional need-based aid in the form of Lafayette College grant assistance.
  * Register during the online registration window in Banner for a winter/summer abroad program. Students who register outside the window will be considered for aid if funding is still available.


The Office of Financial Aid will only send email notifications to students who are awarded an interim grant, indicating their specific grant amount, prior to the interim nonrefundable deposit deadline.
Funding notifications are made by the Office of Financial Aid (please see the Important Dates section above for further details on timing). There is one limited pool of aid for winter and summer interim. Students interested in summer programs should register on the registration date in September in order to ensure consideration for the funding pool. Only students who are awarded funding will be notified.
Eligible students are also encouraged to apply for the Fund for Education Abroad and the Gilman Scholarship.
### Insurance 
Students enrolled in a Lafayette College off-campus interim program occurring outside the United States are automatically enrolled in the College’s overseas health and safety insurance plan. Students enrolled in a Lafayette College off-campus interim program occurring within the United States should continue to use the health insurance program in which they are already enrolled.
Optional trip cancellation insurance is available. Students will receive further information on CFAR (cancel for any reason) insurance in their study abroad portals after registering.

2024-25 Interim Financial Aid Info
Eligible students will be automatically considered for the Bergh Family Fellows Program by the Office of Financial Aid.
### How do I register? 
Please also review the step-by-step registration instructions in the Registration section.
Off-campus interim program registration occurs on the Banner Self-Service system (like registration for any other course). It is a first-come, first-served system and opens at 7:30 am for all students. Students should resolve any account holds prior to registration day. Please see the Important Dates section for this year’s interim registration date.
Students can only register for**one program per interim time period** (i.e. one winter interim program and one May/summer interim program). Students may not register for one program and join the waitlist for another program occurring during the same time period. This means once a student has enrolled in a specific off-campus interim program, they will not have the opportunity to switch to another program.
Students who successfully register in Banner for an interim program must complete their study abroad portal application (instructions will be sent within two business days of registration), which includes a **nonrefundable deposit of $500**. The deadline for submitting these items is listed above in the Important Dates section.
Successful online registration holds a space for a student in a program, but it is not a confirmation of enrollment. To finalize enrollment, students must have a clear disciplinary record (see eligibility page for further information) and complete their study abroad portal application, which includes a $500 nonrefundable deposit. No exceptions can be made to this policy and a spot will not be guaranteed unless these requirements are met by the stated deadline.
If a student successfully registers for an off-campus interim program and is no longer able to or interested in participating, they must notify the office **in writing** by emailing studyabroad@lafayette.edu. Withdrawing after confirming participation in the program by submitting the program deposit will cause the student to incur any non-recoverable costs that the program places in the student’s name.
### What if the program is closed or full? 
If all of the off-campus interim programs that interest a student are closed or full, students should complete a . It is important that students fill out **all** of the information requested to the best of their ability, or else they may not be eligible for waitlist selection.
Students will be moved from the waitlist into programs as space becomes available. Students who indicate an interest in more than one program will be moved into the first program with space. The selected student will be contacted by IOCE about completing their study abroad portal requirements, which includes a $500 nonrefundable deposit. Failure to complete these steps will cause the student to forfeit the space in the program.
Students, parents, etc. should not contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education to ask where the student is on the waitlist. IOCE will contact the student if or when a space is available to them.

### Cost
There are several categories of costs students should consider when planning their semester study abroad experience. These costs are reviewed in detail at the Get Started Session and students are encouraged to share all information with whoever is responsible for paying their educational bills.
#### Tuition
Lafayette students studying abroad with an affiliated program (e.g., Boston University, Temple University, Syracuse University, IES, CIEE, SIT, etc.) **must pay Lafayette College’s tuition (or higher, if the program’s tuition exceeds Lafayette’s)**. Students will be charged the tuition through the Lafayette billing system. Students may **not** pay the program tuition directly, except for the application fee, the required deposit, and any other fees not collected via Lafayette.
#### Room/Board
Lafayette students studying abroad with an affiliated program **pay the program’s room/board fees**. Students do not pay Lafayette room/board during the semester they are abroad. When applicable, students will be charged for the program’s room/board fees through the Lafayette billing system. This allows students to keep maximum financial aid and to retain any payment plans that are in place. Please note that room/board fees are set by individual programs and students are responsible for understanding what those fees amount to and to share that information with their parent/guardian before applying to an affiliated program. Also note board fees may vary as access to meal plans will vary by program and location.
#### Application Fees and Program Deposits
Some programs require an application fee in order to submit a program application. Application fees are the responsibility of the student and are typically non-refundable. Students should carefully consider which program best suits their academic, professional, and personal needs before applying to a program to avoid paying multiple application fees.
Once accepted into a program, most programs require a student to commit to a program by submitting a non-refundable deposit. The program deposit is the responsibility of the student. This deposit is credited to the student’s Lafayette account when IOCE receives the program invoice reflecting the deposit paid. Should a student withdraw from a program after paying the deposit, he/she will be responsible for the deposit amount and any non-recoverable expenses incurred by the program on the student’s behalf. These expenses can include (but are not limited to) airfare, housing fees, and partial or full tuition.
#### Other Program Fees
Some programs may have additional program fees outside of those listed above. These can include (but are not limited to) excursion fees, health insurance fees, lab fees, etc. These fees are the responsibility of the student. Please note these fees are set by individual programs and students are responsible for understanding what these fees amount to and to share that information with their parent/guardian before applying to an affiliated program.
#### Out of Pocket Expenses
Students will encounter some expenses that they will need to pay for directly (they will not pay Lafayette or the affiliated program). These expenses can include (but are not limited to) airfare/baggage fees, visa application fees, meals outside of the program’s designated meal plan, books and supplies, personal travel, etc. These expenses are the responsibility of the student.
#### Financial Aid

### Safety Tips
  * Do not attract undue or unwanted attention to yourself by engaging in behaviors that can mark you as a tourist and thus as a target for pickpockets, etc.
  * Don’t wander around with your face buried in a guidebook or behind a huge map; instead, stop for a moment to consult them in an out-of-the-way spot.
  * Don’t pull large amounts of cash out of your pocket; keep a small amount of cash in one pocket, and if you must carry more, keep it elsewhere on your person.
  * Don’t wear flashy jewelry. Keep expensive cameras in a non-descript carry bag.
  * Don’t yell inappropriately or converse very loudly in public places.
  * Remain aware of your surroundings at all times: Know where you are and where you are going. Don’t travel alone if you can avoid it, and make sure you don’t get separated from your companion(s).
  * To the extent possible, adapt to local standards of dress. If no one else is wearing shorts and flip flops, you shouldn’t either; doing so will make you stand out as a tourist. Note that wearing sneakers and a baseball cap has the same effect in many countries.
  * Be discreet and respectful when taking photographs. If you want to photograph people, ask for their permission first.
  * Carry a list of emergency contact numbers (local and at home) with you at all times.
  * Make sure someone else always knows your travel plans.
  * Wear shoes that are easy to remove for both security screening purposes and for comfort on the flight.
  * Remember TSA restrictions regarding carry-on items, including limitations on liquids and gels (containers of 3 ounces or less, all must fit within a quart-sized Ziplock bag, and each traveler is limited to one such bag).


### Health Tips
  * Familiarize yourself with your program’s health insurance plan and/or the Lafayette international health/safety insurance plan.
  * Have both medical and dental check-ups before you go abroad.
  * Make sure you receive all required vaccinations before you leave. Note that some vaccinations are given in a series of shots administered weeks or months apart, so do not leave this until the last minute. Your program will provide information on necessary vaccinations/medication. You may also consult the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) website.
  * Know what medications are legal/illegal in your destination country. You’d be surprised at what medications other countries either do not allow or for which they have restrictions. This information can be found by connecting with the foreign embassy of your destination country.
  * Obtain enough of all prescription medications that you require for the duration of your program, and make sure to keep them in their original containers with the pharmacy label clearly stating your name and the prescribing doctor’s name. It is also advisable to take a note from your physician stating the medicine you are taking, its dosage, its generic name, and the condition being treated.
  * Make sure you inform your program/program director of any medical conditions for which you might require care or special accommodations while you are abroad (for example diabetes, epilepsy, severe allergies, etc.). Be sure to fully and truthfully complete any medical forms for your program.
  * Know the local conditions that you will encounter while abroad, and consider how this will affect you. Is the weather extreme? Are there common allergens you need to worry about? Does the local diet present any difficulties for you? Is the water safe to drink? Have there been any recent epidemics?
  * As a matter of both health and safety, avoid overindulging in alcohol while abroad, and absolutely refrain from using any illegal drugs.
  * Carry information about blood type, important medical conditions, and any other medical information on your person.


### Disclosure of Medical Conditions and/or Disabilities
The social and cultural changes associated with studying abroad can put students under a great deal of physical and emotional stress, aggravating existing conditions. For this reason, we strongly encourage students to disclose any and all medical, physical, psychological, and/or dietary conditions that may require special accommodation while abroad. Such information will be kept strictly confidential, released only to the Director of the program and any necessary health care professionals should such a need arise.
You can find more information regarding disabilities abroad at http://www.miusa.org
Lafayette College complies with all federal and state legislation and does not in any way discriminate in educational programs on the basis of physical ability.
### Sexual Assault Abroad
If you’ve experienced sexual violence, intimate partner violence, stalking, or other forms of sexual or gender-based harassment, you are likely to have concerns and questions. The below resources are available to you in order to move forward in a way that’s appropriate for you. **If you are experiencing an emergency or need immediate assistance, please call Lafayette Public Safety at 610-330-4444**.

Through the generous support of Linda Assante Carrasco ’90 and Marc A. Carrasco, and their endowed fund - the Global Learning and Community Engagement Fund - Lafayette is piloting a program that supports independent travel for honors thesis research. This initiative grew out of Linda and Marc's vision to encourage and support rigorous and impactful global engagement by students.
In line with Linda and Marc’s vision, priority will be placed on those proposed projects for which the research will clearly benefit from the student traveling and the research addresses current developmental, economic, educational, environmental, political, social, or other related issues at the destination. Preference will be given to those projects that involve international travel and direct engagement with the local population or agencies, institutions, or other stakeholders. Proposals for domestic travel funding should contain a global focus. Faculty travel to accompany the student may also be supported depending on the destination, the nature of the project, and the availability of funds. The time and length of the travel are open and determined by the research goals.
Expand All Collapse All
### Proposal Process 
Proposals will be considered on a rolling basis as long as funding is available. In order to allow for summer travel, full consideration will be given to proposals submitted by May 1 prior to the academic year in which the student will work on the honors thesis. The second round deadline is September 1. Proposals submitted later (for instance, in the fall for January travel) will be considered depending on funding availability but should be submitted no later than November 1. 
Proposals should be submitted through the at least three months before the intended start date of travel, if possible. All proposals will be reviewed by the Associate Dean of the Curriculum in collaboration with the Off-Campus Studies Committee. The following information should be included in the proposal:
  * Name of the student and title of the honors thesis project
  * A description of the honors thesis project and of the anticipated benefits that conducting research abroad would bring to the project (approx. 300-500 words). The description should bring out clearly how the research addresses current developmental, educational, environmental, political, social, or other related issues as well as how the student plans to engage with the local population or agencies, institutions, or other stakeholders.
  * A research plan outlining the goals and a timeline for the research travel component
  * A brief statement of the student’s familiarity with the destination, culture, and language (if applicable); this may be addressed separately or incorporated into the project description
  * A statement of approval by the designated main advisor for the honors thesis, as well as the names and signatures of the additional faculty members anticipated to be on the thesis committee. If obtaining a physical signature is not possible, an email from the faculty members sent directly to the Director of International and Off-Campus Education will suffice.
  * If funding is also sought for faculty travel, a separate detailed rationale, including an anticipated budget, from the faculty member explaining why the student should be accompanied
  * A proposed budget using the IOCE budget template.
  * Depending on the destination where the research will be conducted, the proposal may be subject to further review and approval by the International Risk Committee; applicants will be notified by IOCE if this is the case.


If a proposal for travel and research support is granted, further instructions about travel registration, stipend disbursement, and academic reporting requirements after travel will be sent to the student and associated faculty members. 
### Eligibility Requirements 
Eligibility:
  * Applicants must be in good academic and disciplinary standing
  * Applicants must be working on an honors thesis


### Recipient Expectations and Requirements 
  * Awardees will be required to complete a pre-departure process through IOCE at least two weeks prior to departure for the program.
  * While traveling, recipients will be required to check in periodically with the Director of International and Off-Campus Education.
  * Within 30 days of return, recipients are expected to submit a statement summarizing their research activities to the Director of International and Off-Campus Education
  * When the final thesis is submitted, recipients should share a copy with the Director of International and Off-Campus Education who may share it with other relevant campus offices.


### Whom should I contact with questions? 
Questions about the application process, creating a budget, and travel advice can be sent to Rochelle Keesler at keeslerr@lafayette.edu.
### When would an honors thesis student typically conduct research through travel? 
This fund supports independent travel to support honors thesis research. Students should plan their travel so that it doesn’t interfere with courses. Past participants have conducted research through travel during the summer before their senior year and during the winter interim of their senior year. Students could also potentially travel over the Lafayette fall break, Thanksgiving break, or even spring break if that aligns with their thesis writing timeline.
### How long should research travel be? 
There is no requirement for duration of travel. Supported projects have been between 5-10 days. However, travel duration could be shorter or longer based on the student researcher’s needs.
### How many stipends are awarded and how much are the stipends? 
There is no set number of stipends nor set amounts for stipends. Awards will depend on projects selected for support and their requested funding needs.
### Does this fund provide support for semester or interim study abroad programs? 
No, this fund supports independent travel that is not connected to a credit-bearing study abroad program. However, a student may develop a research project that relates to their abroad experience.
### What if I’m not ready to apply by the May 1 priority deadline? 
Students who are seeking summer funding must meet the May 1 deadline. Students who plan to travel over fall break, Thanksgiving, winter break, or spring break may apply by May 1 for priority consideration OR they may submit their applications for the second deadline of September 1. If funding remains after both application deadlines, we will continue to consider applications for funding on a rolling basis.
### Is this funding open to all majors? 
We invite applications from all thesis projects that align with the goals for the Assante Carrasco Fund (see above for details) regardless of major.
### Can students apply to travel together? 
While the structure of the fund supports independent travel related to honors thesis research, if two or more students happen to be working on separate theses that would benefit from travel to the same location, they could potentially coordinate their travel. However, they should submit individual applications for funding. 
### Whom should I contact with other questions? 
If you have further questions, you can contact Rochelle Keesler at keeslerr@lafayette.edu.

### Safety Tips
  * Do not attract undue or unwanted attention to yourself by engaging in behaviors that can mark you as a tourist and thus as a target for pickpockets, etc.
  * Don’t wander around with your face buried in a guidebook or behind a huge map; instead, stop for a moment to consult them in an out-of-the-way spot.
  * Don’t pull large amounts of cash out of your pocket; keep a small amount of cash in one pocket, and if you must carry more, keep it elsewhere on your person.
  * Don’t wear flashy jewelry. Keep expensive cameras in a non-descript carry bag.
  * Don’t yell inappropriately or converse very loudly in public places.
  * Remain aware of your surroundings at all times: Know where you are and where you are going. Don’t travel alone if you can avoid it, and make sure you don’t get separated from your companion(s).
  * To the extent possible, adapt to local standards of dress. If no one else is wearing shorts and flip flops, you shouldn’t either; doing so will make you stand out as a tourist. Note that wearing sneakers and a baseball cap has the same effect in many countries.
  * Be discreet and respectful when taking photographs. If you want to photograph people, ask for their permission first.
  * Carry a list of emergency contact numbers (local and at home) with you at all times.
  * Make sure someone else always knows your travel plans.
  * Wear shoes that are easy to remove for both security screening purposes and for comfort on the flight.
  * Remember TSA restrictions regarding carry-on items, including limitations on liquids and gels (containers of 3 ounces or less, all must fit within a quart-sized Ziplock bag, and each traveler is limited to one such bag).


### Health Tips
  * Familiarize yourself with your program’s health insurance plan and/or the Lafayette international health/safety insurance plan.
  * Have both medical and dental check-ups before you go abroad.
  * Make sure you receive all required vaccinations before you leave. Note that some vaccinations are given in a series of shots administered weeks or months apart, so do not leave this until the last minute. Your program will provide information on necessary vaccinations/medication. You may also consult the CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) website.
  * Know what medications are legal/illegal in your destination country. You’d be surprised at what medications other countries either do not allow or for which they have restrictions. This information can be found by connecting with the foreign embassy of your destination country.

  * As a matter of both health and safety, avoid overindulging in alcohol while abroad, and absolutely refrain from using any illegal drugs.
  * Carry information about blood type, important medical conditions, and any other medical information on your person.


### Disclosure of Medical Conditions and/or Disabilities
The social and cultural changes associated with studying abroad can put students under a great deal of physical and emotional stress, aggravating existing conditions. For this reason, we strongly encourage students to disclose any and all medical, physical, psychological, and/or dietary conditions that may require special accommodation while abroad. Such information will be kept strictly confidential, released only to the Director of the program and any necessary health care professionals should such a need arise.
You can find more information regarding disabilities abroad at http://www.miusa.org
Lafayette College complies with all federal and state legislation and does not in any way discriminate in educational programs on the basis of physical ability.

### Leading Interim Programs
Every year several Lafayette faculty members take student cohorts abroad/off-campus for short-term study opportunities. These programs typically occur during either the winter interim or during the May/summer time period. If interested in leading an interim program, please contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education. To see the current interim programs available to students please click here.
#### Winter Interim
Winter interim programs are typically 3-4 weeks in length and offer 1 Lafayette course/credit. These programs are intensive in nature, often include full class days, and sometimes include traveling to various locations. Winter interim programs are typically led by 2 faculty members. The timeline for a winter interim program typically looks as follows:
  * December (of previous academic year): Call for proposals goes out
  * February: Proposal deadline
  * March/April: Program list is finalized
  * June/July: Program budget is finalized; logistical planning begins
  * September: Study Abroad Fair; Interim Registration Day
  * December/January: Program departs


#### May/Summer Interim
May/summer programs are typically anywhere from 3-8 weeks and offer either 1 or 2 Lafayette courses/credits (depending on length and course focuses). Longer programs are typically more residential in nature, offering a central place for learning and exploring to occur. May/summer programs are typically led by 2 faculty members. The timeline for May/summer programs typically looks as follows:
  * December (of previous academic year): Call for proposals goes out
  * February: Proposal deadline
  * March/April: Program list is finalized
  * July/August: Program budget is finalized; logistical planning begins
  * September: Study Abroad Fair; Interim Registration Day
  * May-August: Program departs


### Department-Run Short-Term Programs
Apart from programs above that are coordinated and managed in conjunction with our office, some departments may organize their own international travel programs (i.e. Alternative School Break, Rothkopf Scholars, etc.). In this case, the coordination and fiscal arrangements of such programs are the responsibility of the departments.
The Office of International & Off-Campus Education provides health/safety support to all of these programs and so does require specific program- and student-related paperwork to be submitted in advance of the program’s departure date. Please contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education for more details.
### Faculty-Led Semester Programs
Lafayette offers a few semester-long programs in which a student cohort, accompanied by a faculty resident director, studies abroad at a partner institution. You can see the various semester-long programs that are offered on our . If you are interested in leading one of these semester-long programs please contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

By studying abroad/off-campus, LGBTQ+ students have the opportunity to experience their sexual identity and other aspects of their identity from a new cultural perspective. It is important to consider, though, that attitudes and understandings of LGBTQ+ individuals vary by region, country, culture, and individuals abroad. While some countries provide protection and equal rights to LGBTQ+ individuals, others may see identifying openly as an LGBTQ+ individual as punishable by law. It’s important for all students, including LGBTQ+ students, to get to know and understand the host culture’s laws, history, perceptions, and politics before they go abroad/off-campus.
Below are some links to help inform and support LGBTQ+ students as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help LGBTQ+ students prepare for their off-campus study experience. Please also feel free to discuss any questions or concerns with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

International students at Lafayette are already engaging in a cross-cultural experience right here on campus. But these students also have the opportunity to continue broadening their international horizons by studying abroad for an interim or semester program, or by studying off-campus in one of the US-based programs. International students should start the planning and preparation process early – including working with the Lafayette International Student Advising Office to make sure their US student visa will be up-to-date – as they may encounter different visa regulations than American students. Additionally, international students may find that their relationship to a host culture may be different than the relationship of the Americans on their study abroad/off-campus study program.

Study abroad students have access to several useful services provided by the Lafayette Library, including access to subscription databases, electronic document delivery, interlibrary loan, research assistance, and country information.
### Country information
Visit the library’s research tools page on Countries & Maps to locate background information on the country where you’ll be living and studying.
### Access to Databases
Lafayette students have access to subscription web-based resources from abroad. Clicking on a link to a subscription research tool (such as Academic Search Premier, JSTOR, or RefWorks) from the Library web site or Library Catalog when you are off-campus will produce a page that prompts you for your Lafayette College Network ID and password. Once you enter the proper credentials, you will be passed directly to the site.
### Document Delivery
Study abroad students can have journal articles and book chapters from Lafayette-owned materials scanned and delivered as PDFs to their Interlibrary Loan accounts. However, since this service is ONLY offered to Lafayette College students studying abroad, the library needs to know who you are. Please email the Interlibrary Loan department at ill@lafayette.edu to alert us of your study abroad status. Once we have identified you as a study abroad student, when logging into the Interlibrary Loan system, you will see a “Document Delivery Request” option from the main page. Requests are usually filled within 24 to 48 hours.
### Interlibrary Loan (ILL)
Study abroad students may submit requests for journal articles and book chapters unavailable in Skillman or Kirby Libraries or in the library at your host institution. Books cannot be requested via ILL while studying abroad. Log in to the ILL system using your Lafayette Network ID and password and use the request forms located there, or send a request directly from the library’s electronic databases, such as Academic Search Premier, Web of Science, and other periodical databases, using the WebBridge feature. Just look for a link to “Lafayette WebBridge” or the WebBridge icon.
### Research Assistance
Send a research question by email to refdesk@lafayette.edu and receive a response within 24 hours. Students preparing to start researching and writing honors theses when they return from abroad are encouraged to communicate early with librarians. In-person appointments can be arranged via our online form in advance of your return to campus.
### Research Guides
The library has also created a number of guides to help students navigate various stages of the research process. Guides are available for: finding articles; identifying and evaluating primary sources; assessing information sources such as articles and websites; citing articles and web pages; and many other topics.

### How much spending money will you need?
Although this really depends on your personal spending habits and your destination country, you will probably spend more money while studying abroad than you would during the same period at home. Common expenses include eating out, souvenirs/gifts, and—the biggest category—personal travel. The best advice is to talk with other students who have been on your program, and ask them what they tended to spend money on, and then make a personal budget for yourself.
### Your bank 
Let your bank know where you’re going. This includes your destination country, any layover airports, and any countries you plan to travel to while living abroad. If you don’t, your bank may assume your account has been compromised and may freeze your accounts.
### ATMs 
When traveling, debit cards are very convenient: ATMs are generally accessible 24/7, they make it unnecessary to carry large amounts of cash, and the money you receive from an ATM will be in the local currency. Check with the bank that issues your card, however, to learn if/how much they charge for “foreign transaction fees” which can vary greatly from bank to bank. There may also be “external ATM fees” for not using your bank’s ATMs. Check with your bank to see if they have sister banks abroad to avoid the external ATM fees.
### Credit cards 
Taking a credit card can be a good idea in case you have to make a purchase that exceeds the daily limit of your debit card. Credit card may also carry “foreign transaction fees” which can vary greatly from bank to bank.
### Contact info 
Make sure to have a list of customer service numbers to call in case any of your credit cards are stolen—you will want to cancel them immediately. Leave this list with your parents as well, since it may be easier for them to make the calls from the U.S. than for you to do so from abroad.
### Emergency fund 
Take an emergency fund in cash (at least $100) when you are traveling; keep it securely stored in a neck pouch or money belt. It is better to take small bills (10s or 20s).
### Bills back home 
If you will be responsible for paying bills in the U.S. while you are abroad, set up automatic debit or online payment options (through your bank, an online service, or the institutions you have to pay) before you leave.

If you will be responsible for paying bills in the U.S. while you are abroad, set up automatic debit or online payment options (through your bank, an online service, or the institutions you have to pay) before you leave.

### Pack light 
Do not overpack. Lugging huge, heavy bags through airports, train stations, and city streets is exhausting and inconvenient, and may place you as a tourist target. Use website resources like OneBag.com to learn the “art and science” of traveling light.
### Baggage allowances 
Consult the webpage of the specific airline you will use and determine the size and weight limitations for luggage on international flights (which can be different from the limitations for domestic flights) as well as for the number of checked and carry-on bags they allow. If you exceed these limits, you will have to pay a substantial surcharge.
### Your carry-on 
Your carry-on should be used to pack essential items – things you can’t live without in the event that your checked bag is lost in transit. This will include your passport, arrival information for your program, medical information, prescription medication, eyeglasses, valuable items, and enough clothing for a few days.
### Your passport 
Your passport should be packed in your carry-on bag or onboard personal item. Pack a copy of your passport (picture, personal information page, and visa) in all of your checked bags and in your carry-on. You may also leave a copy at home with your parent/guardian.
### Identify your bag 
Make sure you have clear identification on both the outside (luggage tag) and inside of each bag you take. A distinctive marker on the outside of your bag (a large sticker, colorful strap, etc.) will help you identify it easily while traveling.
### Pack an empty bag 
You may wish to pack an empty duffel bag which can lay flat near the top of your suitcase. It works well if you end up buying souvenirs, gifts, etc. and need an extra bag for the additional items for your flight home.
### Buy stuff abroad 
Many items you might think to pack can actually be purchased abroad, such as: toiletries, batteries, notebooks, office supplies, sunscreen, etc. You may wish to pack a travel-size amount of toiletries to get you through the first few days. If you are very specific about brands, ingredients, etc., you should check to make sure those items are available abroad.
### Adapters/converters 
If taking electronic equipment, make sure you have the required adapters (to fit the local outlets) and/or voltage converters. It’s recommended that you leave your low-end electronics (hair dryers/straighteners, electric shavers, etc.) at home and purchase new ones abroad as low-end electronics are more likely to fry than high-end electronics (i.e. laptops, smart phones, which can typically account for a larger range of voltage). Low-end electronics are typically cheap enough to purchase new abroad and you may wish to go in on them with your abroad roommates to ease the cost. Use website resources like WorldStandards to get more information on adapters and converters needed for your destination country.
### Clothing 
Take into consideration your destination’s climate as well as the typical standard of dress—students who have been on your program before can help you with this information. Know that most students pack far too much—remember that you may buy clothes while abroad. Take clothes that you can layer, and if you plan to do a lot of traveling, take durable, drip-dry, no-iron clothes. Definitely take comfortable walking shoes.
### Miscellaneous items you might want to take 
Travel alarm clock, sunglasses, umbrella, small backpack for school books or short trips (could serve as your carry-on too), money belt, and guide book for your country or city. If you plan to travel independently and stay in hostels, a travel sheet (a lightweight silk or nylon bag) and a lightweight travel towel are good investments.

### Passports
Generally speaking, a “valid passport” must be valid (not expired) 3-6 months after the program ends (timing is dependent on the destination country’s specific regulations). Lafayette College requires that a student’s passport does not expire**before 6 months of the end-date of the program.** If you are a US citizen, you can click here to get further information on how to obtain or renew your passport. International students should refer to the Consulate of their own countries of citizenship. If you are planning to apply to go abroad and have not applied for a passport yet, do so immediately—you may even want to pay the extra fee in order to expedite it, since processing time for a new passport can be lengthy, and you will need to have your passport in-hand to apply for a visa if one is required by your study abroad program.
Once you have your passport, make several copies of the photo/personal information page. You will pack at least one copy to take with you, leave one copy with your parent/guardian, and scan one copy on the Lafayette study abroad application portal for the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.
### Visas
Many countries require students to obtain a visa, which can be a time-consuming process (up to eight weeks in some cases) and may require you to go in-person to a consulate. Specifics regarding the need for a visa and the application process depend on your destination country, the length of time you will be there, and your citizenship. Representatives from your study abroad program will help you with the procedural details. You can gather further information on visas for various destination countries here.
## Other Important Documents to Carry with You
  * **Insurance** – All students who go abroad must carry supplemental travel insurance. Please see the Health & Safety Insurance page for more information. 
  * **Emergency Contact Information** – Please update your emergency contact information on Banner Self-Service before you leave. Furthermore, while you are abroad, you should always carry with you a card with the following information: the phone number of your house, apartment, or dorm while abroad; the phone number of the host program’s main office; emergency contact numbers provided to you by your program; the phone number of the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate; and your parent/guardian’s phone number(s).

### Tips to Prepare You for Your Host Culture/Destination
You’ve picked a program, filled out the necessary paperwork, and sat through Pre-Departure Orientation. But you still don’t feel ready! That’s okay—there will be a lot of new things to learn once you’re at your off-campus destination. Before you go, though, there’s tons you can do to prepare yourself and to help you get excited about your upcoming experience. Below are 7 ways you can prepare for what’s up ahead.
Expand All Collapse All
### Utilize the library’s resources 
The Lafayette College Library website provides tons of resources for getting to know your target location and culture before you arrive at your destination. Visit the library website to start exploring.
### Utilize the U.S. Department of State website 
The U.S. Department of State provides country-specific information that may be especially relevant to U.S. citizens. You can learn about safety and health information, in-country transportation options, and the laws and regulations of your destination on the State Department’s website.
### Learn what’s up with culture 
No matter where you’re going, it’s important to be culturally prepared. The What’s Up With Culture website tells you what culture is, why it’s different around the world, and how you can prepare yourself to be open to the differences and challenges you’ll face in your new host culture.
### Study the language before you arrive 
If you’re going to a non-English-speaking country, you’ll probably take courses in the host country’s language once you arrive at your destination. But it doesn’t hurt to start learning some words beforehand. In fact, it can help you to adapt faster, connect with locals, and succeed in your classes.
The best way to learn a new language before you go abroad is with formal instruction on Lafayette’s campus. Lafayette offers a variety of language options in our Languages and Literary Studies department. Visit the LLS website to learn about the language courses offered at Lafayette.
If you don’t have time in your schedule for another language class or your target language isn’t offered on-campus, you can also utilize Lafayette’s Language Library or other free online resources to help you begin learning the language. Below we provide 3 free options for you, but feel free to explore the internet for more resources:
  * Lafayette Language Library is located on the 4th floor of Pardee Hall.
  * Duolingo lets you learn a language while playing games.
  * BBC Languages provides basic phrases in various languages.


### Read local newspapers 
Reading the local news from your destination in either English or in the target language lets you know what’s going on in your target location, and what’s important to the people there, and helps you be prepared to discuss events and politics with the locals.
### Read fiction and non-fiction books 
In addition to the local news, fiction and non-fiction reading about your target location and by writers from your target location lets you get to know the culture and country further.
### Watch movies and television shows 
Use movies/TV shows set in and about your host culture and country to get a better feel for the place. Just note that not all television is created equal. Look for high-quality movies and shows that help you begin to understand the intricacies of your host culture and that don’t generalize or make fun of your host culture.

URL: https://studyabroad.lafayette.edu/prepare-participate-return/cultural-adjustment/

When studying abroad for any period of time, you may go through an adjustment process. In your new international or domestic location you will face a new cultural, academic, political, and environmental setting. You may encounter new ways of thinking that excite and inspire you, and you may also encounter situations and ideas that challenge and frustrate you.
Many students will go through what study abroad professionals refer to as the Cultural Adjustment Curve, shown below. As you look at the curve and move through the process, it is important to note that not all students will engage with the process in the same way. You may skip certain stages, experience the process in a different order, or you may encounter shorter or longer adjustment periods than other students.
It’s important for you to identify your feelings—both positive and negative—during your time abroad and to reflect on these feelings. It’s also important to know that you are not alone in these feelings and that you have resources to connect to both on-site and through Lafayette College. Below are resources available to all Lafayette students studying off-campus.
  * On-site program leaders or administration: Your on-site leaders and program administrators are a good place to start when looking for support during an off-campus or abroad program. They can help point you in the right direction for the resources you need.
  * Medical Insurance Provider: All students are covered by either their affiliated program’s medical insurance or by Lafayette’s On Call International plan. Your medical insurance provider is a good place to look for referrals to local counseling services and mental health professionals.


### The 5 Rs of Culture Change
The 5 Rs of Culture Change is a more recent cultural adjustment model that identifies five key changes (routines, reactions, roles, relationships and reflections about yourself) we face when we move across cultures. It helps us understand  _why_ it is normal to experience ups and downs when moving across cultures and  _why_ stress is a part of the transition process.
Expand All Collapse All
### Routines 
When we first move across cultures many of our routines are disrupted: we eat different foods at different times of the day, we have to navigate a new environment, and we may be without a regular schedule for some time as we get settled. At the same time, even the most basic of routines, from turning on lights, to getting on a bus, to shopping at the grocery store – which we normally do on auto-pilot without much thinking, may suddenly require more (and in some cases our full) focus and energy.
### Reactions 
We do things we are accustomed to doing in our own culture – but we get a very different reaction than we expect in our new culture. While we recognize we probably acted out of the norm for the culture we are in, we don’t have the “key” to unlock this situation and understand exactly why people reacted the way they did. At the same time, we experience a different way of working, interacting or engaging. We ourselves try to react appropriately but find ourselves lacking the appropriate skills to do so effectively, be it a command of the language or the ability to shift styles.
### Roles 
We often experience changes in our roles and responsibilities when we move across cultures. We may carry out the same role but in another culture. We may take on a new or expanded role. We may lose roles that are important to us. We find some roles do not change, but our ability to fulfill these roles does. Additionally, others may see us as playing a particular role, whether or not we define ourselves in this way (e.g. the role of “a foreigner” or as a representative of your home culture). We are likely to experience many forms of role changes, sometimes simultaneously.
### Relationships 
When we move to another culture we discover how to live out our relationships in a new environment and are often challenged not to let the stresses around us enter into these relationships. Our relationships with those we transition with may get stronger, deeper and more profound as a result of going through the change, but they also take work. At the same time, we find other relationships around us changing—we may drift apart from certain friendships back home, be surprised at the newfound sense of closeness and kinship we experience with others despite the distance, and be challenged to recreate relationships in our new environment so we have a sense of community and support.
###  Reflections About Yourself 
As we experience culture change, we may start to notice that we ourselves change in some subtle and not so subtle ways: we may realize we actually really enjoy certain aspects of the lifestyle abroad that we didn’t know we would; or, we realize just how important certain values are to us that we might not have articulated before. We may pick up certain habits, gestures, and ways of being that are now natural to us, but also may surprise and disarm family and friends back home who start to wonder what else has changed about us. We are growing, evolving, and developing—trying to become more aware of who we are culturally and individually speaking—which brings many benefits but often also some confusion and uncertainty.
Kate Berardo, “Framework: The 5Rs of Culture Change,” in  _Building Cultural Competence: Innovative Activities and Models_ , eds. K. Berardo and D. K. Deardorff (Sterling, VA: Stylus, 2012), 193-199.

For all Common Course of Study attributes, students will follow the appropriate steps outlined above in order to have the course approved to transfer back to Lafayette. In **addition** to the steps above, students will complete the electronic common course of study approval form. Students will complete the form and click submit. The form will be directed to the Registrar’s Office for approval. Once the approval request is reviewed, the Registrar will provide the student with a response to their request.
** **Please note for Lafayette-led interim programs** , each program/course is already pre-approved for certain Common Course of Study attributes so students SHOULD NOT submit Common Course of Study approval requests for these programs. Students can find the designated Common Course of Study attributes on each program’s brochure page (brochure links are on the Interim Programs page). Not all programs will have Common Course of Study attributes designated to them and students shouldn’t assume they will gain Common Course of Study credit by participating in an interim program.

URL: https://studyabroad.lafayette.edu/prepare-participate-return/cultural-adjustment/#page

When studying abroad for any period of time, you may go through an adjustment process. In your new international or domestic location you will face a new cultural, academic, political, and environmental setting. You may encounter new ways of thinking that excite and inspire you, and you may also encounter situations and ideas that challenge and frustrate you.
Many students will go through what study abroad professionals refer to as the Cultural Adjustment Curve, shown below. As you look at the curve and move through the process, it is important to note that not all students will engage with the process in the same way. You may skip certain stages, experience the process in a different order, or you may encounter shorter or longer adjustment periods than other students.
It’s important for you to identify your feelings—both positive and negative—during your time abroad and to reflect on these feelings. It’s also important to know that you are not alone in these feelings and that you have resources to connect to both on-site and through Lafayette College. Below are resources available to all Lafayette students studying off-campus.
  * On-site program leaders or administration: Your on-site leaders and program administrators are a good place to start when looking for support during an off-campus or abroad program. They can help point you in the right direction for the resources you need.
  * Medical Insurance Provider: All students are covered by either their affiliated program’s medical insurance or by Lafayette’s On Call International plan. Your medical insurance provider is a good place to look for referrals to local counseling services and mental health professionals.


### The 5 Rs of Culture Change
The 5 Rs of Culture Change is a more recent cultural adjustment model that identifies five key changes (routines, reactions, roles, relationships and reflections about yourself) we face when we move across cultures. It helps us understand  _why_ it is normal to experience ups and downs when moving across cultures and  _why_ stress is a part of the transition process.
Expand All Collapse All
### Routines 
When we first move across cultures many of our routines are disrupted: we eat different foods at different times of the day, we have to navigate a new environment, and we may be without a regular schedule for some time as we get settled. At the same time, even the most basic of routines, from turning on lights, to getting on a bus, to shopping at the grocery store – which we normally do on auto-pilot without much thinking, may suddenly require more (and in some cases our full) focus and energy.
### Reactions 
We do things we are accustomed to doing in our own culture – but we get a very different reaction than we expect in our new culture. While we recognize we probably acted out of the norm for the culture we are in, we don’t have the “key” to unlock this situation and understand exactly why people reacted the way they did. At the same time, we experience a different way of working, interacting or engaging. We ourselves try to react appropriately but find ourselves lacking the appropriate skills to do so effectively, be it a command of the language or the ability to shift styles.
### Roles 
We often experience changes in our roles and responsibilities when we move across cultures. We may carry out the same role but in another culture. We may take on a new or expanded role. We may lose roles that are important to us. We find some roles do not change, but our ability to fulfill these roles does. Additionally, others may see us as playing a particular role, whether or not we define ourselves in this way (e.g. the role of “a foreigner” or as a representative of your home culture). We are likely to experience many forms of role changes, sometimes simultaneously.
### Relationships 
When we move to another culture we discover how to live out our relationships in a new environment and are often challenged not to let the stresses around us enter into these relationships. Our relationships with those we transition with may get stronger, deeper and more profound as a result of going through the change, but they also take work. At the same time, we find other relationships around us changing—we may drift apart from certain friendships back home, be surprised at the newfound sense of closeness and kinship we experience with others despite the distance, and be challenged to recreate relationships in our new environment so we have a sense of community and support.
###  Reflections About Yourself 
As we experience culture change, we may start to notice that we ourselves change in some subtle and not so subtle ways: we may realize we actually really enjoy certain aspects of the lifestyle abroad that we didn’t know we would; or, we realize just how important certain values are to us that we might not have articulated before. We may pick up certain habits, gestures, and ways of being that are now natural to us, but also may surprise and disarm family and friends back home who start to wonder what else has changed about us. We are growing, evolving, and developing—trying to become more aware of who we are culturally and individually speaking—which brings many benefits but often also some confusion and uncertainty.
Kate Berardo, “Framework: The 5Rs of Culture Change,” in  _Building Cultural Competence: Innovative Activities and Models_ , eds. K. Berardo and D. K. Deardorff (Sterling, VA: Stylus, 2012), 193-199.

### Tips to Prepare You for Your Host Culture/Destination
You’ve picked a program, filled out the necessary paperwork, and sat through Pre-Departure Orientation. But you still don’t feel ready! That’s okay—there will be a lot of new things to learn once you’re at your off-campus destination. Before you go, though, there’s tons you can do to prepare yourself and to help you get excited about your upcoming experience. Below are 7 ways you can prepare for what’s up ahead.
Expand All Collapse All
### Utilize the library’s resources 
The Lafayette College Library website provides tons of resources for getting to know your target location and culture before you arrive at your destination. Visit the library website to start exploring.
### Utilize the U.S. Department of State website 
The U.S. Department of State provides country-specific information that may be especially relevant to U.S. citizens. You can learn about safety and health information, in-country transportation options, and the laws and regulations of your destination on the State Department’s website.
### Learn what’s up with culture 
No matter where you’re going, it’s important to be culturally prepared. The What’s Up With Culture website tells you what culture is, why it’s different around the world, and how you can prepare yourself to be open to the differences and challenges you’ll face in your new host culture.
### Study the language before you arrive 
If you’re going to a non-English-speaking country, you’ll probably take courses in the host country’s language once you arrive at your destination. But it doesn’t hurt to start learning some words beforehand. In fact, it can help you to adapt faster, connect with locals, and succeed in your classes.
The best way to learn a new language before you go abroad is with formal instruction on Lafayette’s campus. Lafayette offers a variety of language options in our Languages and Literary Studies department. Visit the LLS website to learn about the language courses offered at Lafayette.
If you don’t have time in your schedule for another language class or your target language isn’t offered on-campus, you can also utilize Lafayette’s Language Library or other free online resources to help you begin learning the language. Below we provide 3 free options for you, but feel free to explore the internet for more resources:
  * Lafayette Language Library is located on the 4th floor of Pardee Hall.
  * Duolingo lets you learn a language while playing games.
  * BBC Languages provides basic phrases in various languages.


### Read local newspapers 
Reading the local news from your destination in either English or in the target language lets you know what’s going on in your target location, and what’s important to the people there, and helps you be prepared to discuss events and politics with the locals.
### Read fiction and non-fiction books 
In addition to the local news, fiction and non-fiction reading about your target location and by writers from your target location lets you get to know the culture and country further.
### Watch movies and television shows 
Use movies/TV shows set in and about your host culture and country to get a better feel for the place. Just note that not all television is created equal. Look for high-quality movies and shows that help you begin to understand the intricacies of your host culture and that don’t generalize or make fun of your host culture.

Please contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education for more information on insurance costs. Please note this insurance does not cover US-based health and safety needs and should not replace US-based health coverage. For details about the Lafayette insurance program, visit the Online Resource Hub. There, you can find the ID card and benefits summary and the full program description. You can also contact the On Call International Customer Service number (1-855-878-9590) for information on services and benefits.
If you are a student studying on an interim program, faculty-led semester program, or an affiliated semester program, please see below regarding insurance coverage.
If you are a student planning to participate in student club travel or independent travel sponsored by Lafayette, please see additional information here.
If you are a faculty or staff member traveling for work-related purposes, please see the Information for Faculty section for insurance information.
### Lafayette Interim Programs
All students participating in an international Lafayette-sponsored winter or May/summer interim program are typically covered under the insurance program as part of their program fee. Additional registration is not required to be covered by the insurance program. You can learn more about our insurance program, On Call International, above. Students participating in US-based off-campus programs should continue to use the US-based insurance plan they already have and are encouraged to contact their insurance company in advance of travel to determine coverage at the program site.
### Lafayette Faculty-Led Semester Programs
All students participating in a Lafayette-sponsored faculty-led semester program (i.e. Lafayette Engineering in Madrid) are typically covered under the insurance program as part of their tuition fee. Additional registration is not required to be covered by the insurance program. You can learn more about our insurance program, On Call International, above.
### Affiliated Semester Programs
All students participating in a Lafayette affiliated program (i.e. IES Buenos Aires) are typically covered under Lafayette’s On Call insurance program as part of their tuition fee. Additional registration is not required to be covered by the insurance program. You can learn more about our insurance program, On Call International, above.

Many affiliated semester programs also include/require enrollment in their own health/safety insurance program for student participants. In this case, students will be covered by On Call International through Lafayette College and will also register for and utilize the program’s health/safety insurance plan. Any additional fees for plans provided by or required by affiliated partners are the responsibility of the student.
Students studying on a US-based semester program should continue to use the US-based insurance plan they already have.
### National Insurance Plans
In many cases, students on semester affiliated or Lafayette faculty-led programs will also enroll in a national insurance plan of their host country as part of their immigration requirements.
### Cancellation & Interruption for Any Reason Insurance (CFAR/IFAR)
Lafayette College travelers may want to consider purchasing Cancellation & Interruption For Any Reason (CFAR/IFAR) insurance for domestic and international trips. This type of insurance is not offered by Lafayette and is not included with affiliated or Lafayette faculty-led programs but may be purchased individually for Lafayette-sponsored or personal travel.
#### CFAR/IFAR Insurance for Winter and Summer Lafayette Programs
Program-specific optional CFAR/IFAR insurance is available for students participating in Lafayette winter and summer interim programs at an additional cost to the traveler. More information about the plan can be found in the protection plan summary. Please consult the 2025 CFAR Optional Insurance for Interim Programs list to register for coverage for a specific program. You must purchase CFAR insurance for interim programs within 14 days of paying the deposit.
#### CFAR/IFAR Insurance for All Other Travel
There are several CFAR/IFAR insurance options available online to choose from. While you are free to purchase CFAR/IFAR coverage from any provider, our broker, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., has vetted the option below as a comprehensive solution that provides 75% reimbursement for CFAR/IFAR claims.
For more information on Travel Insured International through Gallagher:
  * Travel Insured International CFAR/IFAR Program Flyer
  * Travel Insured International Enrollment Summary CFAR/IFAR
  * Travel Insured International Website


For the option offered through Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., travelers must enroll in CFAR/IFAR insurance within 21 days of receiving a non-refundable bill for a coverable expense. Typically, the earliest coverable expense will be the non-refundable program deposit, which is charged by the College or a third-party program provider when a traveler commits to a specific program and the trip becomes non-refundable.

All students participating in a Lafayette affiliated program (i.e. IES Buenos Aires) are typically covered under Lafayette’s On Call insurance program as part of their tuition fee. Additional registration is not required to be covered by the insurance program. You can learn more about our insurance program, On Call International, above. Students who need to show a Proof of Coverage Letter to their program or for visa application purposes should contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.
Many affiliated semester programs also include/require enrollment in their own health/safety insurance program for student participants. In this case, students will be covered by On Call International through Lafayette College and will also register for and utilize the program’s health/safety insurance plan. Any additional fees for plans provided by or required by affiliated partners are the responsibility of the student.
Students studying on a US-based semester program should continue to use the US-based insurance plan they already have.
### National Insurance Plans
In many cases, students on semester affiliated or Lafayette faculty-led programs will also enroll in a national insurance plan of their host country as part of their immigration requirements.
### Cancellation & Interruption for Any Reason Insurance (CFAR/IFAR)
Lafayette College travelers may want to consider purchasing Cancellation & Interruption For Any Reason (CFAR/IFAR) insurance for domestic and international trips. This type of insurance is not offered by Lafayette and is not included with affiliated or Lafayette faculty-led programs but may be purchased individually for Lafayette-sponsored or personal travel.
#### CFAR/IFAR Insurance for Winter and Summer Lafayette Programs
Program-specific optional CFAR/IFAR insurance is available for students participating in Lafayette winter and summer interim programs at an additional cost to the traveler. More information about the plan can be found in the protection plan summary. Please consult the 2025 CFAR Optional Insurance for Interim Programs list to register for coverage for a specific program. You must purchase CFAR insurance for interim programs within 14 days of paying the deposit.
#### CFAR/IFAR Insurance for All Other Travel
There are several CFAR/IFAR insurance options available online to choose from. While you are free to purchase CFAR/IFAR coverage from any provider, our broker, Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., has vetted the option below as a comprehensive solution that provides 75% reimbursement for CFAR/IFAR claims.
For more information on Travel Insured International through Gallagher:
  * Travel Insured International CFAR/IFAR Program Flyer
  * Travel Insured International Enrollment Summary CFAR/IFAR
  * Travel Insured International Website


For the option offered through Arthur J. Gallagher & Co., travelers must enroll in CFAR/IFAR insurance within 21 days of receiving a non-refundable bill for a coverable expense. Typically, the earliest coverable expense will be the non-refundable program deposit, which is charged by the College or a third-party program provider when a traveler commits to a specific program and the trip becomes non-refundable.

### Passports
Generally speaking, a “valid passport” must be valid (not expired) 3-6 months after the program ends (timing is dependent on the destination country’s specific regulations). Lafayette College requires that a student’s passport does not expire**before 6 months of the end-date of the program.** If you are a US citizen, you can click here to get further information on how to obtain or renew your passport. International students should refer to the Consulate of their own countries of citizenship. If you are planning to apply to go abroad and have not applied for a passport yet, do so immediately—you may even want to pay the extra fee in order to expedite it, since processing time for a new passport can be lengthy, and you will need to have your passport in-hand to apply for a visa if one is required by your study abroad program.
Once you have your passport, make several copies of the photo/personal information page. You will pack at least one copy to take with you, leave one copy with your parent/guardian, and scan one copy on the Lafayette study abroad application portal for the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.
### Visas
Many countries require students to obtain a visa, which can be a time-consuming process (up to eight weeks in some cases) and may require you to go in-person to a consulate. Specifics regarding the need for a visa and the application process depend on your destination country, the length of time you will be there, and your citizenship. Representatives from your study abroad program will help you with the procedural details. You can gather further information on visas for various destination countries here.
## Other Important Documents to Carry with You
  * **Insurance** – All students who go abroad must carry supplemental travel insurance. Please see the Health & Safety Insurance page for more information. 
  * **Emergency Contact Information** – Please update your emergency contact information on Banner Self-Service before you leave. Furthermore, while you are abroad, you should always carry with you a card with the following information: the phone number of your house, apartment, or dorm while abroad; the phone number of the host program’s main office; emergency contact numbers provided to you by your program; the phone number of the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate; and your parent/guardian’s phone number(s).

### Welcome Back to Lafayette!
We hope you enjoyed and learned from your off-campus experience and we’re happy to have you back at Lafayette. Similar to when you first arrived abroad, coming back can be both exhilarating and challenging. While abroad you may have gone through culture shock and/or cultural adjustment. Now you might be facing reverse culture shock. Know that, during your time abroad, you changed. You grew, you learned new things–maybe a new language, new cultural norms, new ideas and perspectives–and while you’re still you, you’re a different you than before you left. That’s okay! Readjusting back to life on-campus will take some time. If you find adjusting to be challenging, utilize the below resources available to you.
  * Understand what reverse culture shock is.
  * Get in touch with the Lafayette Counseling Center for free counseling sessions.
  * Talk to us! The Office of International & Off-Campus Education would love to hear about your experience.

Religion and spiritual life are important components for many students on campus as well as for many cultures abroad. When studying abroad/off-campus, students may find that host cultures may have completely different sets of beliefs and customs or may approach similar beliefs in a different way. Studying abroad in a country that has a different religious majority than what students are accustomed to can be challenging, but can also be an opportunity to broaden their perspectives and to connect across spiritual boundaries.
Below are some links to help inform and support students wishing to explore religion and spiritual life as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help students prepare for their off-campus study experience. Please also feel free to discuss any questions or concerns with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

### Overview
By working with partnering affiliated programs, Lafayette is able to offer students over 200 semester programs in over 57 different countries. Students may choose the fall or spring semester to study abroad, or an entire academic year, depending on major, course requirements, course sequencing, class year, interests, destination, etc. Affiliated programs available to Lafayette students can be found on our . The Lafayette application deadlines for semester-long affiliated programs are March 1 for the Fall Semester and October 1 for the Spring Semester (NOTE: affiliated partners will have their own applications to complete, which may have earlier deadlines; deadlines to petition for eligibility or for temporary affiliation of a program not affiliated through Lafayette is one month earlier).
Please note all students wishing to study abroad on a semester affiliated program must first attend a Get Started Session and then meet with an advisor in IOCE.
### Cost
There are several categories of costs students should consider when planning their semester study abroad experience. These costs are reviewed in detail at the Get Started Session and students are encouraged to share all information with whoever is responsible for paying their educational bills.
#### Tuition
Lafayette students studying abroad with an affiliated program (e.g., Boston University, Temple University, Syracuse University, IES, CIEE, SIT, etc.) **must pay Lafayette College’s tuition (or higher, if the program’s tuition exceeds Lafayette’s)**. Students will be charged the tuition through the Lafayette billing system. Students may **not** pay the program tuition directly, except for the application fee, the required deposit, and any other fees not collected via Lafayette.
#### Room/Board
Lafayette students studying abroad with an affiliated program **pay the program’s room/board fees**. Students do not pay Lafayette room/board during the semester they are abroad. When applicable, students will be charged for the program’s room/board fees through the Lafayette billing system. This allows students to keep maximum financial aid and to retain any payment plans that are in place. Please note that room/board fees are set by individual programs and students are responsible for understanding what those fees amount to and to share that information with their parent/guardian before applying to an affiliated program. Also note board fees may vary as access to meal plans will vary by program and location.
#### Application Fees and Program Deposits
Some programs require an application fee in order to submit a program application. Application fees are the responsibility of the student and are typically non-refundable. Students should carefully consider which program best suits their academic, professional, and personal needs before applying to a program to avoid paying multiple application fees.
Once accepted into a program, most programs require a student to commit to a program by submitting a non-refundable deposit. The program deposit is the responsibility of the student. This deposit is credited to the student’s Lafayette account when IOCE receives the program invoice reflecting the deposit paid. Should a student withdraw from a program after paying the deposit, he/she will be responsible for the deposit amount and any non-recoverable expenses incurred by the program on the student’s behalf. These expenses can include (but are not limited to) airfare, housing fees, and partial or full tuition.
#### Other Program Fees
Some programs may have additional program fees outside of those listed above. These can include (but are not limited to) excursion fees, health insurance fees, lab fees, etc. These fees are the responsibility of the student. Please note these fees are set by individual programs and students are responsible for understanding what these fees amount to and to share that information with their parent/guardian before applying to an affiliated program.
#### Out of Pocket Expenses
Students will encounter some expenses that they will need to pay for directly (they will not pay Lafayette or the affiliated program). These expenses can include (but are not limited to) airfare/baggage fees, visa application fees, meals outside of the program’s designated meal plan, books and supplies, personal travel, etc. These expenses are the responsibility of the student.
#### Financial Aid
All academic year financial aid travels with a student when they study abroad on an affiliated program, with the exception of work-study hours and RA benefits. Please see the Financial Planning page for more detailed information on financial aid and scholarships.

URL: https://studyabroad.lafayette.edu/semester-faculty-led-programs/

### Overview
Lafayette has developed several semester-long faculty-led programs in partnership with overseas institutions to suit our students’ academic needs. Typically, faculty directors from the College rotate each semester and bring their unique expertise to a given program by offering a course their respective disciplines. Students select their remaining courses from the local host school’s course catalog, therefore enriching the students’ curriculum, language exposure, and cross-cultural competence. Throughout the years, Lafayette has built strong partnerships with host programs. Once students have been accepted into a faculty-led program, they will meet with their faculty director and the Director of International & Off-Campus Education for several pre-departure preparatory meetings.
Lafayette runs semester-long faculty-led programs to the following locations:
  * **For Engineering students (Spring of sophomore year; applications due March 1 of first year):**


  * **For non-Engineering students (Fall-term only):**


Faculty-led semester programs might have special application deadlines (e.g., the Engineering programs recruit a full year before the departure date!). Please check on the program brochure page (linked above) or with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education about upcoming deadlines.
### Cost
For semester faculty-led programs students continue to pay Lafayette tuition and room/board fees. These fees typically cover tuition, room/board, round-trip airfare, program-related excursions and activities, and Lafayette’s international health and safety insurance plan. Some modifications to the board fee may occur depending on the meal plans available on-site.

Historically, students of color have been underrepresented in the study abroad experience. However, the number of students of color participating in study abroad is increasing. In addition to general questions about study abroad, students of color may wonder how they will be perceived abroad. It is important to remember that every country’s culture, attitudes, and norms are different, and that, even within a country, different regions (i.e. urban vs. rural) will vary in perspective. As well, some students may find that their nationality may take precedence over ethnic or racial identification in terms of host country perception. As with any aspect of a student’s experience, it’s also important to keep in mind that each individual will have a unique experience.
Below are some links to help inform and support students of color as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help students of color prepare for their off-campus study experience. Please also feel free to discuss any questions or concerns with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

Student-Athletes make great study abroad participants. Already well-versed in organization, flexibility, and perseverance, student-athletes have already honed many of the skills needed to have a successful and enjoyable study abroad experience. Student-athletes will face some challenges, though. Timing a study abroad experience among athletic, academic, and social commitments can be tricky. Additionally, keeping up with a workout regimen and athletic skills while studying abroad takes preparation. It’s important for student-athletes to speak to their coaches, student-athlete support services through the Academic Resource Hub (formerly known as ATTIC), academic advisor, and the Office of International & Off-Campus Education to find the best time and location to go abroad, to talk about NCAA compliance and eligibility, and to prepare for academic, athletic, and personal needs while abroad. With planning, student-athletes can have a successful international experience and can utilize their athletic skills to take advantage of sport-related cultural immersion opportunities while abroad.
Below are some links to help inform and support student-athletes as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help student-athletes prepare for their off-campus study experience. Please also feel free to discuss any questions or concerns with the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.

STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) students are studying abroad at rapidly increasing numbers. Even so, some students will encounter challenges when planning and preparing for an international experience. For STEM students, it’s important to begin the planning process early, especially when it comes to academics. Students should continuously speak with their academic advisers about the courses they should take on-campus before they go abroad, when the best time is for them to go abroad, and what courses they should look for while abroad. It’s also important to keep in mind that academics vary greatly in different countries. Course demands may be higher, support services may be less available, and teaching styles will vary. This is all part of the cultural experience and students should be prepared to display flexibility and perseverance in their academic lives abroad. Students can work with both the Office of International & Off-Campus Education and their academic department/adviser to plan for their time abroad.

Students with disabilities is a broad term that can encompass a wide variety of challenges that students face in their everyday lives. Whether a student is living with a physical impairment, structured mental health management, or is in need of academic support services, these students will need to prepare to continue managing these aspects of their lives while abroad. It is important that students work with the Academic Resource Hub (formerly known as ATTIC), the College Counseling Center, the Office of International & Off-Campus Education, and the host institution abroad to collect and communicate information and to arrange appropriate support abroad. Early planning is encouraged and often necessary as the host institution abroad may have to take several steps in order to prepare to adequately support a student with a disability. It’s also important to keep in mind that every culture views disability differently in their perceptions, norms, and laws. Some study abroad locations will offer more adequate support services than others. The good news is that, for many students with a disability, skills like flexibility and perseverance are already highly developed and will be helpful when adapting to a new place and culture.

Historically, students of color have been underrepresented in the study abroad experience. However, the number of students of color participating in study abroad is increasing. In addition to general questions about study abroad, students of color may wonder how they will be perceived abroad. It is important to remember that every country’s culture, attitudes, and norms are different, and that, even within a country, different regions (i.e. urban vs. rural) will vary in perspective. As well, some students may find that their nationality may take precedence over ethnic or racial identification in terms of host country perception. As with any aspect of a student’s experience, it’s also important to keep in mind that each individual will have a unique experience.
Below are some links to help inform and support students of color as they plan and prepare to study abroad. The resources are not all-inclusive but are a good starting point to help students of color prepare for their off-campus study experience.

  * A Release and Waiver of Responsibility form
  * Your point-to-point itinerary and contact information
  * Copy of your passport


International Travelers should review the U.S. Department of State and Center for Disease Control‘s websites for country-specific information.
If your trip is targeting a high-risk destination, additional information, forms, and approvals may be required.
Please note that you need to start the above procedure at least two months before your scheduled departure so as to allow enough time to go over the above steps and allow the Office of International & Off-Campus Education to assist you with this process. Failure to do may cause a delay in the trip approval, making it necessary for you to postpone your trip.
### Procedure when traveling domestically in the USA 
When such scholarship requires students to travel unaccompanied by a member of Lafayette’s faculty or staff and to spend at least one night off-campus, and if their travel plans are limited to the **US territory** , the following procedure must be observed:
  1. Sign the Release and Waiver of Responsibility form and submit it to the person or office that is sponsoring your travel.
  2. Provide your point-to-point itinerary and contact information to the same person or office.


### Funding for independent international travel 
In addition to following the Procedures for Unaccompanied Student Travel, any student who wants to apply for funding for independent international research must submit a proposal to the Academic Research Committee. Proposals should include the following information:

While Lafayette College encourages all students, faculty, and staff to engage in off-campus activities, including study abroad, internships, research, volunteer activities, and music performances or sports competitions in various countries, the College is also concerned with the safety of its constituents. The following policy provides guidance on how Lafayette College evaluates its sponsored activities in high-risk destinations. This may include countries where the US State Department has issued a level 3 or level 4 travel advisory, as well as countries without a Travel advisory that still pose a significant threat to the health and safety of students, faculty, and staff, and to the running of the program.
### Risk Assessment Committee for Off-Campus Studies
The Risk Assessment Committee for Off-Campus Studies exists to assess the risks of any off-campus program that may, for any reason, appear to present significant concerns for the safety and well-being of the participants.
The committee shall consist of the Dean of the Faculty, the College’s Risk Manager, the College’s Legal Counsel, the Director of International & Off-Campus Education, and a faculty member of the Off-Campus Studies Advisory Committee. The committee may consult with other members of the campus community with expertise pertinent to specific situations. Recommendations of the committee regarding a change in status of a program will be made to the Provost, who will have the sole authority for the final decision to continue or discontinue the program.
### Procedure
An evaluation by the Risk Assessment Committee for Off-Campus Studies will generally be initiated by level 3 or 4 travel advisories issued by the U.S. State Department. Additionally, members of the campus community can petition the committee to conduct an evaluation. Any recommendations on changing the status of a program will be made to the Provost, who will have the sole authority for the final decision.
If a program/trip is targeting a high-risk country, students and/or their faculty or staff advisers may be invited to participate in a risk assessment meeting. Prior to the meeting, a pre-departure report may be requested, and during or after the meeting additional information and waiver of responsibility forms may be required. Please note that, if a student or group is planning to travel to a high-risk country, the risk assessment evaluation and procedure must start at least two months before the scheduled departure so as to allow enough time to review the case. Failure do so may cause a delay in program approval, which may make it necessary for the student or group to postpone the scheduled program.
Level 3 or 4 travel advisories containing the following designations will automatically cause the College to cancel its sponsorship of an activity:
  1. orders for departure of US dependents and non-emergency personnel;
  2. departure recommendations for any US citizens remaining in the country after the initial order for US dependents and non-emergency personnel to depart;
  3. strong warnings to US citizens against travel to the country; and
  4. warnings to US citizens to defer (nonessential) travel to the country.


To learn more about the risk assessment process or to get started with the risk assessment process, please contact the Office of International & Off-Campus Education.
### How to Petition for a Risk Assessment
Any member of the campus community who is concerned that the College is sponsoring a program in a destination that exposes Lafayette students, faculty, and/or staff to an inordinate level of risk may submit a written petition for assessment of the program to the Director of International & Off-Campus Education, who will then forward the petition to the committee. The petition should explain the factors contributing to the perception of inordinate risk and should include appropriate documentation of these factors (government reports or warnings, news reports, etc.).
### Refunds
When Lafayette College officially suspends travel prior to the commencement of a program or activity abroad, the student shall be entitled to a full refund of all monies paid to date related to that program, excluding any nonrefundable deposits. Should Lafayette College suspend an international program while it is in progress, every effort will be made by the College to evacuate participants in the program. Any unexpended funds or refunds received from canceled activities will be returned to the student.
Students who voluntarily withdraw from a program where Lafayette College has not officially suspended the program will be responsible for all unrecoverable costs incurred to the date of withdrawal, as well as any nonrefundable deposits that were made.
