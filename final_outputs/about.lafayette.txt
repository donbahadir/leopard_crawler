## Namesake and History
More than two centuries ago, a 19-year-old left home to follow a dream. He came to a new place far away, remade himself as a student and scholar and became a leader and a hero. His lifelong philosophy was so important to him he had its Latin translation emblazoned on his family crest. “Cur Non.” Today, at the college that bears his name, we embrace that philosophy daily.

Soldier. Revolutionary. Statesman. Hero of Two Worlds.
A young, wealthy French aristocrat with an impressively lengthy name, Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, defied his own king to enter the American Revolution against Great Britain. After his success as a military leader, he became an influential statesman who continued to support democratic revolutions and human rights causes throughout his long and illustrious career.
Born in 1757 into a family with illustrious ancestors on both sides, Lafayette at first appeared destined for a conventional aristocratic, military career. But he had other ideas.
He adopted the motto “Cur Non” (“Why Not?”) for his coat of arms and joined the Freemasons, who supported Enlightenment principles, in 1775. Two years later, at the age of 19, lured by the idea of a nation fighting for liberty and perhaps seeking revenge for the death of his father by a British cannon ball during the Seven Years’ War, Lafayette resigned his commission in the French military. He bought a ship and sailed to America, a difficult and lengthy voyage, to volunteer in the Continental Army under Gen. George Washington.
He explained his attraction to the American cause in a letter to his wife: “The welfare of America is intimately connected with the happiness of all mankind; she will become the respectable and safe asylum of virtue, integrity, tolerance, equality, and a peaceful liberty.”
Receiving his commission as major general in the Continental Army in 1777, Lafayette first saw action in September of that year at the Battle of Brandywine where he was shot in the leg and recovered from his wound at the Moravian settlement in Bethlehem, Pa. His heroism in the battle encouraged Washington to give the young Frenchman command of a division, and Lafayette stayed with his troops at Valley Forge. After a visit to France in 1779, he returned to America in 1780 with assurances of thousands of French troops who would join the war, and helped Franco-American forces win the surrender of a large British army at Yorktown, Va., in 1781, the last major battle of the war.
After the American Revolution, Lafayette became an international antislavery advocate and took on many other social justice causes. Working with Thomas Jefferson, he helped write the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Men and of the Citizen, the first step toward a constitution for the Republic of France, helping launch the French Revolution. Lafayette was a political prisoner in Austria and Prussia from 1792-97 after fleeing radical revolutionaries in France until Napoleon Bonaparte arranged for his release.
Throughout his career as statesman, he befriended Native Americans, defended the rights of French Protestants and Jews before and during the French Revolution, backed national revolutions in Europe and South America, spoke out against capital punishment and solitary confinement, and supported women and their ideas and causes.
At the invitation of President James Monroe in 1824, Lafayette returned to the United States for the last time. During his triumphal Farewell Tour of America in 1824-25, conducted as the nation prepared for its 50th anniversary celebration, Lafayette received affection and gratitude from Americans in all 24 states who enthusiastically embraced the last significant surviving general of the American Revolution.
His arrival in New York inspired four days and nights of continuous celebration—a response replicated during his visits to each of the other states, which hosted parades, balls, dinners, and other celebratory events in Lafayette’s honor.
During the tour, he became the first foreign dignitary to address a joint session of Congress and met with the current, past and future presidents from John Adams to Andrew Jackson. His travels in Virginia in 1825 culminated with his final visits with Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, and Monroe before he returned to France that September aboard the USS Brandywine, the frigate named in honor of the 1777 battle in which Lafayette was wounded.
Among the many Americans moved by Lafayette’s visit was Easton lawyer James Madison Porter, whose father and uncle served with Lafayette in the Battle of Brandywine. After meeting him at an 1824 reception in Philadelphia, Porter proposed naming Easton’s new college after Lafayette as “a testimony of respect for his talents, virtues, and signal services . . . in the great cause of freedom.” Porter would go on to serve as the College’s guiding hand for decades as president of its board of trustees.
On June 30, 1832, a month after the first students matriculated at Lafayette College, five of them—members of the Franklin Literary Society—wrote to Lafayette that they had made him an honorary member to pay “a feeble though sincere tribute of regard to a man who has proved his own and our country’s benefactor, and whose enlarged philanthropy as with a mantle of blessedness would cover the whole family of man.”
Lafayette died in Paris on May 20, 1834, and was buried in Picpus Cemetery with soil from Bunker Hill.
On Aug. 7, 2002, Congress made Lafayette an honorary citizen of the United States, an honor afforded to only eight individuals, including Winston Churchill. Lafayette and Mother Teresa were the only two made honorary citizens directly by an act of Congress.
In May 2010, Lafayette College, the only college in America to bear his name, awarded Lafayette the honorary degree of Doctor of Public Service at its 175th commencement.
Lafayette’s sword, taken from him when he was captured in Austria in 1792, is one of the most precious artifacts in the Marquis de Lafayette Collections at Lafayette College. It is brought out during commencement and other special ceremonies at the College.

A College built from the hopes and dreams of a young nation by inspired citizens who named it for a Revolutionary War hero. A pioneering institution that continues to reshape itself to best serve its educational and philosophical missions.
**The Concept for a College**
Even before the American Revolution, Easton had established itself as a strategic hub of commerce at the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers. By the time war broke out with the Great Britain, Easton had dwarfed its neighboring communities of Bethlehem and Allentown in size and influence, sending one of its own, ironmaster George Taylor, as a delegate to the Continental Congress to sign the Declaration of Independence. Easton was among the first locations in the nation outside of Philadelphia to hear a public reading of the document.
Easton’s population continued to expand through the end of the 18th century and into the early 1800s with the discovery of vast deposits of anthracite coal in northeastern Pennsylvania. Immigrants flocked to the city to help build and later work on a canal system that would deliver coal and other raw materials to markets in Philadelphia.
By the 1820s, Easton’s surging prosperity and prestige took another step forward with the creation of one of its signature institutions.
**James Madison Porter** , a young attorney born outside of Philadelphia who would become U.S. secretary of war, arrived in Easton in 1818 to serve as deputy attorney general for Northampton County.
Porter, the son of an American Revolution veteran, understood, like many Americans, the significance when the Marquis de Lafayette, the last surviving major general of the war, arrived in the United States to begin his final, triumphal tour in 1824.
That same year he and 200 other Easton residents eagerly traveled to Philadelphia to meet the aging French hero who would draw large, enthusiastic crowds at events held in his honor, reenergizing the old spirit of 1776 across a nation preparing for its 50th anniversary.
Porter was moved by his conversation with Lafayette, who remembered Porter’s father and uncle who served with him at the Battle of Brandywine in 1777, according to _The Biography of a College_ by **David Bishop Skillman** , Class of 1913.
Not long after his encounter with Lafayette, he traveled to the Military Academy in Norwich, Vt., and Dartmouth College, where the idea of founding a college in Easton first came to his mind. Porter returned to Easton, knowing that the prosperous city was fertile ground on which to establish a college where he would eventually teach jurisprudence and political economy and serve for decades as president of the Lafayette College Board of Trustees.
**The Origins of a Name**
On Dec. 24, 1824, newspapers carried the following message: “The citizens of the County of Northampton, friendly to the establishment of a college at Easton, in which, besides military science and tactics, the various other branches of education, including the German language, shall be taught, are requested to meet at the Easton Hotel on Monday evening 27th inst. at half past six o’clock to adopt the necessary measures to procure a charter of incorporation.”
In March 1826, the citizens of Easton received a charter signed by Pennsylvania Gov. John Andrew Shulze establishing Lafayette College. Article 1 of the College charter states directly: “In memory of and out of respect for the signal services rendered by General Lafayette in the great cause of Freedom, the said College shall be forever hereafter called and known by the name Lafayette College.”
Skillman recounts in his book: “That as a testimony of respect for the talents, virtues and signal services of General La Fayette in the great cause of freedom, the said institution be named, ‘La Fayette.’ The spelling was formalized to Lafayette in 1876 by **William Cassidy Cattell** , president of Lafayette from 1863-83, based on the spelling used by Lafayette in his own signature.
**The Early Years**
In 1832, the College purchased nine acres on a hill across Bushkill Creek from Easton. Initially named Mount Lafayette, it quickly became known by the name still in use today: College Hill. That same year, the Rev. George Junkin, a Presbyterian minister, agreed to move the curriculum and student body of the Manual Labor Academy of Pennsylvania from Germantown to Easton and take up the Lafayette College charter.
On May 9, 1832, classes in mathematics and the classics began in a rented farmhouse on the south bank of the Lehigh River, where the 43 students worked in the fields and workshops to earn money to support the educational program. Around the time of the American Civil War, Lafayette became the first college in America to establish a chair for the study of English language and literature. **Francis A. March** , the first professor to hold the chair, achieved international acclaim for his work in establishing English as a pivotal subject in the liberal arts curriculum.
In 1866, industrialist **Ario Pardee** gave a $100,000 gift “for the endowment of a scientific course at Lafayette College.” The endowment established a curriculum for civil and mining engineering, as well as chemistry, and an additional $200,000 gift brought about Pardee Hall, which housed the departments until 1927.
With Pardee’s gifts, Lafayette became a school of arts, science, and engineering. This sentiment was articulated in an 1866 report from the board of trustees.
They “set the goal of educating not just the engineer” but the whole person “who is able to meet the challenges of a world in which scientific, technological, and human needs have steadily become more complex.”
The resulting—and ongoing—union of arts, sciences, and engineering remains perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Lafayette curriculum.
**Growth and Change**
Throughout its history, Lafayette College continued to shape itself to best serve its educational mission, supporting the tradition of liberal arts education while responding to the challenges and opportunities of a changing society. Enrollment reflected that: By the start of the 20th century, it had reached almost 300 students. By 1910, enrollment had passed the 500 mark. During the 1920s, it reached 1,000.
After World War II, enrollment more than doubled again as returning veterans sought opportunities in higher education.
In 1970, the first women entered the student population—women now make up about half the student body—raising total enrollment to about 2,100.
Today, Lafayette enrolls about 2,500 students drawn from 43 U.S. states and territories, as well as 52 countries, all gathered together on 340 acres in 69 buildings. Lafayette has 215 full-time faculty members, of whom 99% hold a doctorate or other terminal degree and offers a bachelor of arts in 37 fields and a bachelor of science in 16 fields, including five in engineering.
**The Campus Today**
New campus facilities continue to meet the needs of the College’s academic programming and enrollment.
The 165-bed, mixed-use McCartney Street residences opened in fall 2020, along with the neighboring Trolley Stop diner and the new College Store and Café, which are open to the public and campus community.
Opened and dedicated in September 2019, the Rockwell Integrated Sciences Center offers a signature space for the biology and computer science departments and environmental science and environmental studies programs.
It also houses the Bradbury Dyer, III ’64 Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, Daniel and Heidi ’91 Hanson Center for Inclusive STEM Education, Office of Sustainability, and additional space for neuroscience. Rockwell also houses the multi-disciplinary environmental engineering lab, which is part of the shared space for the new integrative engineering program. Named for Trustee Emeritus **S. Kent Rockwell ’66** , the $75 million center is the largest capital project in Lafayette’s history.
The Williams Arts Campus, completed in 2016 at a cost of more than $24 million, is the primary gateway between Lafayette’s main campus and the city’s downtown. Encompassing several buildings and most of a city block, the campus offers space for painting, sculpture, and drawing studios for faculty and students, classrooms, the Grossman Gallery, studios for theater, a sound stage, a black box theater, and media and teaching labs.
As Lafayette College prepares for its 200th anniversary in 2026 to celebrate James Madison Porter’s dream, its vision remains clear: to teach the habits and subjects of a disciplined mind, the skills to conduct careful research and come to considered conclusions, and the desire and ability to lead a purposeful life.

Nearly 250 years ago, a 19-year old defied his king to follow his convictions. Crossing an ocean, he came to America to join the cause of liberty.
There he became a major general and fought alongside patriots, forging deep ties with George Washington and other Founding Fathers. His journey to this young republic redefined the course of his life and marked his start of shaping history on two continents.
These experiences gave birth to a philosophy that guided him so profoundly that he eventually had its Latin translation emblazoned on his family crest:
Cur Non. Cur Non means Why Not.
Today, at the college that bears his name, we embrace that philosophy every day. We challenge our students to move beyond the familiar, comfortable, and easy. We dare them to live boldly as thinkers, doers, and leaders. We offer them opportunities to engage in every aspect of learning and to use their intellect, talent, and energy to find their place in the world.

A College built from the hopes and dreams of a young nation by inspired citizens who named it for a Revolutionary War hero. A pioneering institution that continues to reshape itself to best serve its educational and philosophical missions.
**The Concept for a College**
Even before the American Revolution, Easton had established itself as a strategic hub of commerce at the confluence of the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers. By the time war broke out with the Great Britain, Easton had dwarfed its neighboring communities of Bethlehem and Allentown in size and influence, sending one of its own, ironmaster George Taylor, as a delegate to the Continental Congress to sign the Declaration of Independence. Easton was among the first locations in the nation outside of Philadelphia to hear a public reading of the document.
Easton’s population continued to expand through the end of the 18th century and into the early 1800s with the discovery of vast deposits of anthracite coal in northeastern Pennsylvania. Immigrants flocked to the city to help build and later work on a canal system that would deliver coal and other raw materials to markets in Philadelphia.
By the 1820s, Easton’s surging prosperity and prestige took another step forward with the creation of one of its signature institutions.
**James Madison Porter** , a young attorney born outside of Philadelphia who would become U.S. secretary of war, arrived in Easton in 1818 to serve as deputy attorney general for Northampton County.
Porter, the son of an American Revolution veteran, understood, like many Americans, the significance when the Marquis de Lafayette, the last surviving major general of the war, arrived in the United States to begin his final, triumphal tour in 1824.
That same year he and 200 other Easton residents eagerly traveled to Philadelphia to meet the aging French hero who would draw large, enthusiastic crowds at events held in his honor, reenergizing the old spirit of 1776 across a nation preparing for its 50th anniversary.
Porter was moved by his conversation with Lafayette, who remembered Porter’s father and uncle who served with him at the Battle of Brandywine in 1777, according to _The Biography of a College_ by **David Bishop Skillman** , Class of 1913.
Not long after his encounter with Lafayette, he traveled to the Military Academy in Norwich, Vt., and Dartmouth College, where the idea of founding a college in Easton first came to his mind. Porter returned to Easton, knowing that the prosperous city was fertile ground on which to establish a college where he would eventually teach jurisprudence and political economy and serve for decades as president of the Lafayette College Board of Trustees.
**The Origins of a Name**
On Dec. 24, 1824, newspapers carried the following message: “The citizens of the County of Northampton, friendly to the establishment of a college at Easton, in which, besides military science and tactics, the various other branches of education, including the German language, shall be taught, are requested to meet at the Easton Hotel on Monday evening 27th inst. at half past six o’clock to adopt the necessary measures to procure a charter of incorporation.”
In March 1826, the citizens of Easton received a charter signed by Pennsylvania Gov. John Andrew Shulze establishing Lafayette College. Article 1 of the College charter states directly: “In memory of and out of respect for the signal services rendered by General Lafayette in the great cause of Freedom, the said College shall be forever hereafter called and known by the name Lafayette College.”
Skillman recounts in his book: “That as a testimony of respect for the talents, virtues and signal services of General La Fayette in the great cause of freedom, the said institution be named, ‘La Fayette.’ The spelling was formalized to Lafayette in 1876 by **William Cassidy Cattell** , president of Lafayette from 1863-83, based on the spelling used by Lafayette in his own signature.
**The Early Years**
In 1832, the College purchased nine acres on a hill across Bushkill Creek from Easton. Initially named Mount Lafayette, it quickly became known by the name still in use today: College Hill. That same year, the Rev. George Junkin, a Presbyterian minister, agreed to move the curriculum and student body of the Manual Labor Academy of Pennsylvania from Germantown to Easton and take up the Lafayette College charter.
On May 9, 1832, classes in mathematics and the classics began in a rented farmhouse on the south bank of the Lehigh River, where the 43 students worked in the fields and workshops to earn money to support the educational program. Around the time of the American Civil War, Lafayette became the first college in America to establish a chair for the study of English language and literature. **Francis A. March** , the first professor to hold the chair, achieved international acclaim for his work in establishing English as a pivotal subject in the liberal arts curriculum.
In 1866, industrialist **Ario Pardee** gave a $100,000 gift “for the endowment of a scientific course at Lafayette College.” The endowment established a curriculum for civil and mining engineering, as well as chemistry, and an additional $200,000 gift brought about Pardee Hall, which housed the departments until 1927.
With Pardee’s gifts, Lafayette became a school of arts, science, and engineering. This sentiment was articulated in an 1866 report from the board of trustees.
They “set the goal of educating not just the engineer” but the whole person “who is able to meet the challenges of a world in which scientific, technological, and human needs have steadily become more complex.”
The resulting—and ongoing—union of arts, sciences, and engineering remains perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Lafayette curriculum.

After World War II, enrollment more than doubled again as returning veterans sought opportunities in higher education.
In 1970, the first women entered the student population—women now make up about half the student body—raising total enrollment to about 2,100.
Today, Lafayette enrolls about 2,500 students drawn from 43 U.S. states and territories, as well as 52 countries, all gathered together on 340 acres in 69 buildings.
