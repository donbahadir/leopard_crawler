URL: https://academics.lafayette.edu/undergraduate-research/excel-scholars-program/

As an EXCEL Scholar, you can get involved with research projects such as measuring the effect of steroid hormones on male zebra finches, analyzing economic growth factors, developing a solar device to disinfect water supplies, co-directing a dramatic performance, or researching the history of New York City for a professor's next best-selling book. 
These are the type of “deep dive” intellectual opportunities provided through the EXCEL Scholars program that fuel our students’ curiosity and passion for topics that interest them. Scholars work closely and collaboratively with faculty on significant research projects that hone critical-thinking and communication skills.
  * Read articles about EXCEL Scholars projects.


You become a part of the program through nomination by a faculty member. As an EXCEL Scholar, you will be an integral part of the research process; the nature of the work is not clerical, nor is it primarily focused on routine chores.
You are challenged to make a significant contribution and are involved in all aspects of the research, from reading and analyzing articles to designing experiments, testing hypotheses, interpreting data, and writing articles about the results for publication.
### Benefits
EXCEL Scholars earn $9 to $11 an hour. They may work full time during the summer (10 weeks) and interim session (3 weeks in January). They may also work part time (8-10 hours per week) during the academic year.
During the summer and interim session, EXCEL Scholars are also provided free college housing in the residence halls.
Besides the stimulating academic challenge that the program provides, EXCEL Scholars have the opportunity to apply techniques and knowledge that they learn in class to specific problems. This kind of hands-on experience is an asset for students applying to graduate schools or seeking professional employment.
Your participation may lead to a coauthored article published in a scholarly journal, a patent for equipment or a technique that you develop, or the creation of works of art. You may also present your findings at one or more professional conferences such as the annual National Conference on Undergraduate Research, which is held at a different college or university each year. Lafayette College has one of the largest contingents of student presenters at NCUR.
### How to Get Involved
The program is open to sophomore, junior, and senior full-time Lafayette students in all disciplines who have at least a 3.00 GPA. Research opportunities are available in engineering, natural sciences, humanities, and social sciences.
To nominate an EXCEL Scholar, a faculty member submits a proposal to the Academic Research Committee. Faculty who have grants that support student research assistants may apply to have their students join the EXCEL Scholars program.
The program is central to Lafayette’s dedication to providing unique academic opportunities and promoting the personal mentoring of students by faculty. It began in 1986 with 14 students. The program now has an annual budget of over $500,000 with more than 160 students participating each year. The success has made the program a model for other colleges and universities. Support for EXCEL comes not only from outside faculty research grants, but also from endowments, private foundation grants, and College funds.
### Lafayette College offers a variety of resources that support faculty and student research.

> My approach to teaching is to present topics in a logical and organized fashion while connecting them to real-world applications, making the content more relevant and relatable. … As an instructor, I work hard to establish trusting and productive relationships with students and establish an environment where students feel comfortable and supported. 
Melissa Gordon
assistant professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering

> I tell stories through images, static or moving, often using performance to ground them. My influences represent a broad swath of interests that include abstraction, politics, humor, feminism, and art history. … By calling into question how we understand history and the elusive nature of truth, my work reveals the subjectivity of both.

> As students come from diverse backgrounds, it is important for them to learn to engage with one another’s thoughts and ideas on a level of civility and mutual respectfulness, especially when discussing a subject as potentially contentious as religion.

> I’m a geologist who specializes in volcanoes. I want to know why and how magma bodies form, evolve, destabilize, and erupt. … It’s exhilarating to see students have that first ‘aha!’ moment in research—whether it happens on the side of a volcano in Iceland, looking down a microscope in my lab, or plotting data to test a hypothesis.

URL: https://academics.lafayette.edu/undergraduate-research/departmental-honors/

Lafayette encourages and recognizes superior academic work. Since 1926, students have had the opportunity to explore topics that interest them and distinguish themselves by pursuing honors in a particular major or interdisciplinary program.
Students who do honors projects are guided by a faculty member with whom they begin conversations well before the senior year. In many cases, the student has previously worked with the faculty member on an EXCEL Scholars research project or completed an independent study. Once the thesis is written, the student defends it before a committee that includes his or her mentor, all or part of the departmental faculty members, and in some cases, a guest faculty member from another college.
To qualify for honors, students must have a cumulative average of 3.00 and an average of 3.20 in the honors department. As seniors, they take the fall and spring thesis courses. The transcripts of students who receive honors bear the legend “Honors in [department or program name] with Thesis.”
### Why Pursue Honors?
Students cite many reasons for deciding to strive for honors, including:
  * preparation for graduate school
  * employ research skills on a topic of personal interest
  * techniques learned will be valuable for future plans
  * synthesize four years of knowledge
  * different learning experience than coursework
  * combine two or more academic interests
  * explore a topic in depth
  * an accomplishment that demonstrates high ability
  * an exciting challenge

The National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) uniquely showcases research done by undergraduates in all fields of study on a national stage. Conference attendees are able to present their research in a variety of formats, including oral presentations, poster presentations, performance, film, and visual arts displays. In previous years, more than 2,800 faculty and students from over 300 institutions attended NCUR in person, making it the largest celebration of undergraduate research.
  * Read an article on students who presented at NCUR 2019 and their research.


Every year, Lafayette provides funding to support the travel and lodgings for a limited number of students and faculty mentors to attend the spring conference in-person. Conference registration fees and some meal expenses are the responsibility of the department or program associated with the student’s research. In the fall, students must submit their abstract to the Lafayette Faculty Affairs and Resources Committee (FARC) for approval prior to submitting their abstracts to NCUR. Only those students who are approved through FARC will receive funding from the College to support their in-person attendance. 
For more information, contact Millie Smith, who coordinates Lafayette’s participation in NCUR.
