##  Barcelona - Liberal Arts & Business
#### Program Overview
There are a wide variety of courses available, primarily taught in English by our world-class faculty. When you arrive, you are grouped into language proficiency-based levels to focus your course enrollment options. This will also provide a sense of community with your fellow students and will challenge you to maximize your learning.
In addition to your Spanish language course, you will choose from a variety of English-taught IES Abroad courses, as well as Spanish- and English-taught local university courses to round out your semester. All IES Abroad courses include field study activities that help you connect coursework with your surroundings. You can also take Spanish-taught IES Abroad courses.
#### Why Barcelona?
Come let Barcelona enchant you. Whether it is the salty sea air, the sweep of mountains in the distance, or the romance and excitement of Las Ramblas, where else can you marvel at Gaudi's whimsical architectural genius while embracing the laid-back Spanish lifestyle?
#### Student Life
We strive to make sure you feel safe, cared for, and at home while you’re away from home. Whether it’s the orientation program that makes you feel prepared, your housing that is well-located and comfortable, the cultural events that make it easy and fun to meet other international and local students, or the field trips and walking tours that take you to places tourists don’t usually see—we’re all about our student service. Learn more about the day-to-day studying abroad on this program. From field trips to housing, it’s all on IES Abroad’s website. **Get started**.

Program Description:
**IFSA - UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE, PEMBROKE COLLEGE PARTNERSHIP** Cambridge, England **WHY STUDY IN CAMBRIDGE?** Founded as lively market town with wide stretches of green along the River Cam, Cambridge is now a quintessential university town with history and charm. The city skyline is dotted with college spires, medieval buildings, and traditional English architecture. The university’s 31 colleges provide a steady stream of entertainment and social events seven days a week, with central London just an hour away by train. **ABOUT THE PROGRAM** Study at one of Cambridge’s oldest colleges, in the nexus of historic methods and cutting-edge research. You will have unparalleled access to experts in your discipline in the halls of Pembroke College. There are no traditional classes at the University of Cambridge. Rather, Cambridge has the supervision system, which is a weekly one-on-one, or in a small group, with your supervisor, in which you discuss your work and the topics that you are studying, ask questions, and receive feedback. Students typically take two courses, called ‘papers’ at Cambridge per semester. Each paper typically consists of eight hour-long supervisions. A course of lectures also supplements your supervisions for each paper, and your supervisor will advise you about which lectures you should attend. You may study in one of the following departments: 
  * Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic Studies
  * Archaeology
  * Asian and Middle Eastern Studies
  * Classics
  * Economics
  * Education
  * English
  * History
  * History of Art
  * Linguistics
  * Mathematics
  * Modern and Medieval Languages
  * Philosophy
  * Human, Social, and Political Science (Political Science, International Affairs, Anthropology)
  * Theology, Religion, and Philosophy of Religion

**ACTIVITIES & EXCURSIONS** Program activities and excursions are designed to enhance your intercultural competence by developing your understanding of the local culture and people. While optional, they are included in your total program fee. Activities and excursions vary each term based on availability, but may include:

#####  **THE CITY OF CAIRO **
###### In Cairo--home to over 20 million--the ancient and the modern, the rural and the urban are brought together on the banks of the Nile in one of the most fascinating cities of the world. For a thousand years, Cairo has flourished as one of the vital centers of the Arab world. 
###### **THE AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN CAIRO**
###### Founded in 1919 to offer a comprehensive American-style, liberal arts education to Egyptian students, The American University in Cairo (AUC) enrolls 7,000 students in its degree, Arabic language and study abroad programs. AUC students hail from over 60 different countries, but the majority of students are Egyptians.  AUC holds institutional accreditation from the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools in the United States (MSCHE /"Middle States"). The University is also fully accredited by ABET and AACSB. Credits earned at AUC are transferable to any U.S. college or university, provided that course material is approved on an individual basis by the home institution.
###### **AUC CAMPUS**
###### In 2008, the University campus moved from its location in central downtown Cairo to the **suburb of New Cairo, a development comprising 46,000 acres of land and with a projected population of 2.5 million people. The new 260-acre complex weaves Egyptian urban and architectural traditions into a modern campus that places a distinct emphasis on environmental sustainability.**
###### **The campus offers state-of-the-art resources to students and faculty from Egypt and around the world and is accessible to persons with disabilities. Campus facilities include libraries boasting** the largest English-language research collection in Egypt, a travel office, bank, fully-staffed medical clinic, counseling center, student dormitories, a state-of-the-art athletic complex, and a variety of food services. Take a virtual tour of the campushere.
###### A University shuttle system provides convenient access to downtown Cairo, from which students can explore a wealth of cultural opportunities. The Cairo Museum--the world's richest repository of pharaonic antiquities--is only a short walk from the old campus center, while the pyramids of Giza, the tombs of Saqqara, and the myriad mosques of medieval Cairo are all within an hour's ride.
###### **PROGRAM OPTIONS** **General Study Abroad** --Students choose classes from among more than 30 undergraduate programs. The language of instruction is English, but Arabic language courses are offered as well. For study abroad students wishing to study Arabic alongside general courses from other disciplines, AUC offers a wide range of non-intensive classes in Modern Standard Arabic and Egyptian Colloquial Arabic.
###### **Arabic Language Institute--** In its Arabic Language Institute (ALI) AUC maintains what is probably the largest corps of full-time, professional Arabic language teachers in the world, and its many Arabic programs have earned international renown for their quality and competence. The ALI Intensive Arabic Program is ideal for students wishing to maximize their progress in Arabic language study by focusing exclusively on Arabic for the period of their study abroad. Students in this program take a full course load of intensive classes in Arabic language and Egyptian culture. 
###### Both programs are offered during the 6-week summer session and the two full semesters (fall and spring.) The general Study Abroad program is also available during the 3-week winter session. Students attending the summer and winter programs take reduced course loads to correspond with the shorter periods of instruction. 
###### **COURSE LOAD**
###### The full course load at AUC is four or five classes (12-15 credits) per semester. The standard summer session load is 2 classes (6 credits); the winter session, one class (3 credits.) Study Abroad students must maintain full-time status in order to qualify for a student visa.

Almost all international students will travel on their own or with student-organized groups to tourist sites in Egypt and to other countries in the region.

Program Description:
**New Activisms, Human Rights and Social Justice** This program explores the struggles of people in Mesoamerica, a region that stretches from southern Mexico to Costa Rica. You will learn more about the human rights crisis the region currently faces from the perspective of historically marginalized communities (such as Indigenous and Afro-descendant people, peasant communities, women, members of LGTBQ+, and youth). You will explore the historical causes of social, ethnic, racial, and political conflicts that have shaped the region and engage with communities, groups and individuals who are organizing themselves to respond to the challenges they face today. The unique histories and lives of the people you will meet not only inspire, but will also challenge you to think about your role as an agent of change.
Learn more and apply to this program
**Highlights**
  * Learn about diverse approaches to environmental conservation, sustainability, economic issues, and social justice. 
  * Frequent guest speakers, excursions, and hands-on active learning to immerse you in the community and culture.
  * Spanish language class with native Spanish speakers in small class sizes. All Spanish levels are welcome, from beginners to native speakers!
  * Participate on a program run by an organization dedicated to social justice, which uplifts the voices of underrepresented and marginalized peoples in all programs.
  * Homestays with welcoming and friendly folks in each country.
  * Travel to two countries in one semester - Guatemala and Costa Rica, with additional travel within each country.

**Courses** Courses are taken on a block schedule (one course at a time). All students will take the following courses, completing 17 Augsburg University credits during the semester: 
  * Spanish – up to 12 course choices available from beginning to advanced
  * Latin American Liberation Theologies and Social Change (Religion 336); **or** Liberation Psychology and Social Change (Psychology 290)
  * Citizen Participation with a Globalized Economy (Political Science 310)
  * In the Aftermath of War: History, Memory and Transitional Justice in Central America (History/Women, Gender, Sexuality Studies 355)
  * Topics: Central American Cultures & Global Competency Certificate (Interdisciplinary Studies 291)

**Student Life** Students will spend the first half of the program in Guatemala, learning about Guatemalan history, culture, and Indigenous populations, while also studying Spanish. Small and intimate language classes provide unlimited opportunities to practice Spanish. Students will stay in a mixture of lodgings and with families throughout all of these excursions. Upon departing Guatemala, students will travel to Costa Rica, where the second half of the program will take place. The center of operation is the Latin American Biblical University, which serves as a space for classes and as a residence hall before moving in with families for the remainder of the semester. Students will stay with local families in the Cedros de Montes de Oca, a diverse middle-class neighborhood, located just outside the capital city of San José. You will go on excursions and field visits to self-sustaining eco-community, rural areas, and meet with immigrants, Afro-Caribbean Costa Ricans, artists, activists, and more! **Why This Program** This program is ideal for students whose career goals include working with immigrant populations in the U.S. (especially from Central America); working for Development Organizations and NGOs addressing developing issues and policies in the Global South; or students who imagine a life and career in grassroots organizing and activism in the U.S. While those might not be your career option, the program provides all students the personal and professional growth necessary to be aware and have a broad understanding of the world and their place in it. **For More Information**

“Studying abroad with CYA was truly an experience like no other and is something I will carry with me for the rest of my life. Spending a semester abroad comes with a wide range of benefits, such as making new friends, experiencing different cultures, cultivating a sense of independence, and learning how to multitask many elements of life. Greek culture is like no other, and made my study abroad experience feel very unique compared to what it would've been like to study in another European city. Ultimately, studying abroad at CYA is an experience I would do again 100 times if I had the chance, as it has allowed me to grow so much as a person and has given me people and memories I will never forget.” Mia Iannios, George Washington University, Fall 2023  CYA also offers Summer, Winter, and Post-Baccalaureate programs.

## Amsterdam - Law & Criminology
#### Program Overview
Your program starts in Amsterdam where you'll spend the majority of your semester. Then, finish the last two weeks of your program in London where you'll complete an academic field study. Are you considering attending law school after graduation? Learn about comparative law in an international context while studying abroad with us in the Netherlands, where local students start their law degrees at the Bachelor’s level. This program gives you a glimpse of your future in law school and what sort of legal career you may enjoy. You’ll discuss major issues in law and society in a foundational international law class, and gain a micro-credential in sustainability through our equitable living course.
By enrolling in this program, you add international law and criminology experience to your transcript—a great talking point when interviewing for law school or your first job. While in Amsterdam, you will take 15-17 IES Abroad credits, with the choice to take one course at a prestigious local university, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU). 
#### Why Amsterdam?
As a major hub for international law, Amsterdam offers exposure to global legal practices. With the presence of institutions like the International Court of Justice, the European Union, and various non-governmental organizations, you’ll gain firsthand insight into how global law works in practice, fostering a truly international mindset.

## Berlin - Language, Culture & Politics
#### Program Overview
The minute you step off the plane in Berlin, you'll feel its energy. It's a place of new ideas, where sustainable technology and modern design are a way of life, and art galleries can be found on nearly every corner. But don't forget, this dynamic city is also a center of modern European history--it has no equal for leaving its imprint on the political, social, and cultural history of the 20th century. We invite you to study in Berlin and to explore one of the world's most vibrant cities.
Specially-designed to improve your German language skills, the IES Abroad Berlin Language & Area Studies Program draws upon Berlin's rich culture and tradition to connect your coursework with the living history of the city. IES Abroad courses are taught in German by local faculty, and a variety of academic options are available at local universities. 
#### Why Berlin?
Berlin is a modern city rebuilt on a tumultuous past. Let history surround you in Berlin, as you see the future boldly reflected in the architecture, innovation, and culture that characterize this great city today.
#### Student Life
We strive to make sure you feel safe, cared for, and at home while you’re away from home. Whether it’s the orientation program that makes you feel prepared, your housing that is well-located and comfortable, the cultural events that make it easy and fun to meet other international and local students, or the field trips and walking tours that take you to places tourists don’t usually see—we’re all about our student service.

## Amsterdam – Psychology & Sciences
#### Program Overview
Envision yourself in a bio lab or a psychology lecture. Now look around you—you're surrounded by Dutch and international students.

#### Why Amsterdam?
Known for its liberal views and open-minded attitude, the residents of Amsterdam welcome you to this cozy city. You'll adore the lovely canals and old European charm that make up the enchanting city of Amsterdam. Because the city planning hasn't changed much since the 19th century, you'll appreciate the architecture and historic homes that color the city. And you can't leave without seeing the windmills!

## Cape Town - University of Cape Town
#### Program Overview
In Cape Town, every day will be like a choose-your-own-adventure book, with outdoor activities to enjoy, South African residents to meet, and African cultures to learn.
Field experience in and around Cape Town is a core component in our program. Participate in field work and research opportunities (like the University's Students' Health and Welfare Centres Organisation's volunteer program) that will give you practical exposure to topics you're learning at South Africa's leading research university, the University of Cape Town (UCT). Through these opportunities, you will get a first-hand look at the city's society and a landscape that is constantly changing.
Cape Town will be your classroom. From visiting local gems like the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Gardens (a natural UNESCO World Heritage Site) and the Castle of Good Hope, we challenge you to take full advantage of South Africa's beautiful climate and geography. We'll also take you to Kruger National Park for a three-hour game drive with one of Kruger's experienced game rangers. Hopefully your adventure will include seeing the "Big Five"--welcome to study abroad!
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.
#### Why Cape Town?
Don't miss the once-in-a-lifetime chance to study abroad in one of the most beautiful cities on Earth. You'll love the crystal clear blue waters, the breathtaking mountains, and everything in between. But there's more to Cape Town than its beauty--its dynamic society is ever-changing and growing, and you can witness it first-hand. Immerse yourself in the African culture and explore one of the most diverse environments in the world. We know you'll agree that studying in Cape Town will make you feel like you're on top of the world.

Program Description:
## Rabat - Study in Rabat
#### Program Overview
As you walk the boulevards of Rabat, it's hard not to be enchanted by the mystery and tradition of this timeless city. From the bustling souqs and energizing atmosphere of the city to the serenity of the surrounding mountains and sea, Rabat is an ideal place to learn about the languages, cultures, and religions of North Africa and the Arab world.
Delve into the fascinating layers of this North African nation as you learn Modern Standard Arabic with courses at the beginning, intermediate, and advanced levels. Learn Colloquial Moroccan Arabic to communicate with local Moroccans, and if you have already taken advanced French, you can take French-taught area studies courses at the IES Abroad Center or local universities. Our area studies courses focus on North African and Islamic Studies and introduce you to the many influential forces shaping the history and culture of Morocco.
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.
#### Why Rabat?
Chances are you're craving a new way of learning—a new way of seeing the world. Consider studying somewhere exotic, somewhere with a melting pot of cultures and influences; somewhere that's located close to ancient ruins, the beach and the mountains; somewhere with a rich history, but definitely a modern flair, too. You can have all of this and so much more when you study abroad in Rabat.
#### Student Life
We strive to make sure you feel safe, cared for, and at home while you’re away from home. Whether it’s the orientation program that makes you feel prepared, your housing that is well-located and comfortable, the cultural events that make it easy and fun to meet other international and local students, or the field trips and walking tours that take you to places tourists don’t usually see—we’re all about our student service. Learn more about the day-to-day studying abroad on this program. From field trips to housing, it’s all on IES Abroad’s website.

## Paris - French Studies
#### Program Overview
With its grand boulevards, world-famous monuments, and iconic skyline (think: the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame, and Sacré Coeur!), it will be difficult to leave this charmingly romantic city. Along with its many historic world-renowned museums, art flourishes in Paris in the form of public gardens, sidewalk cafés, and outdoor markets, fragrant with fresh fruit and pastries.
This program combines rigorous study of the French language with a broad range of classes taught in French by accomplished faculty. You can also experience what life is like for French students by taking one or more courses at a local French university. Tutoring is available if you need help with the transition to higher education in France.
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details. 
#### Why Paris?
You know what it's like to fall in love—but Paris won't break your heart. You'll want to spend all of your time admiring cultural icons like the Eiffel Tower. You'll get lost in the city's exquisite art scene. You'll want to savor the decadent French cuisine at local restaurants. You'll take long walks along the River Seine and wander aimlessly through the city streets for hours. All in the name of love. Je t'aime, Paris!

##### **STUDY ABROAD AT OXFORD** **University of Oxford,****All Colleges & Halls**
**About the Programs** Dive into your discipline with Oxford’s tutorial system! You will be a visiting student at a specific college, and will focus your studies on your major and minor subjects. Most tutorials will be one-on-one or small group meetings between students and tutors, though some science subjects have lectures as well. For specific information about each of our University of Oxford programs, please see the specific college or hall listing within your school’s study abroad student portal:
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Hertford College
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Lady Margaret Hall
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Mansfield College
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Regent’s Park College
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Anne’s College
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Anne’s College - Premedical Program
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Catherine’s College
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Edmund College
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, St. Peter’s College (Summer)
  * IFSA - University of Oxford, Worcester College

**Academics**
  * Study at one of the world’s most prestigious universities
  * Classic tutorial-based courses allow you to delve deeply into your subject area. The one-on-one teaching format means that your syllabus is flexible based on your interests.
  * Join a non-auditioning and very welcoming student choir that performs regular performances and weekly lunch time concerts.
  * Participate in a diverse range of social activities, including dances, jazz and cocktails, quizzes, movie nights and more.
  * Facilities for most major sports in or near the college, including a boathouse for student use.
  * Fall students can arrive early for the Early Start/September Seminar, which awards an additional 4 U.S. semester credit hours. This option is available at the following programs:
    * Hertford College
    * Lady Margaret Hall
    * St. Anne’s College
    * St. Anne’s College - Premedical Program
    * Worcester College


**Tutorial System** The hallmark of the University of Oxford academics is the tutorial system. The tutorial is typically a one-hour meeting between one or two students and the tutor. Tutorials usually meet once a week or every other week, and at the center of the tutorial is an essay on a topic the tutor previously assigned. The tutor will lead a discussion about the essay topic in an effort to provide new insights. At the end of the tutorial, the tutor will assign a new topic and may offer recommended reading. Tutorials are individually arranged, taking into account the subject to be studied and the tutor's area of expertise. They are similar to independent study courses, but Oxford students bear even more responsibility for conducting independent research and maintaining good academic progress. The University of Oxford organizes weekly lectures on myriad academic subjects, and all students at the University, regardless of college, are welcome to attend. Lectures are not usually mandatory except for some science subjects, but tutors often recommend them as good supplements to tutorials and research. **About Oxford** Oxford is a bustling, modern city anchored by an air of academic tradition, with a diverse population and an urban edge. Oxford offers incredible architecture, from medieval to modern, cultural events, museums, concert halls, river sports in addition to pubs, restaurants, and nightlife.  **Afford Your Journey** Grants, financial aid, credit card payments and more are available. IFSA scholarships are primarily need-based and factor in any additional cost your study abroad program might have over home school tuition. The awards are $500 for summer programs, $1,500 for semester programs, and $2,500 for full year programs. These scholarships may apply to any IFSA program, with the exception of our custom programs. **Take the Next Step!**

Program Description:
**IFSA - UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW PARTNERSHIP** Glasgow, Scotland **WHY STUDY IN CITY?** Glasgow has been voted European City of Culture and is home to the national Scottish ballet, orchestra, and chorus. It’s also known as one of the U.K.’s top cities for both traditional and extreme sports. Glasgow offers students the perfect mix of trendy west end cafés and restaurants, a wide range of shopping in the sophisticated Merchant City, and the green space of the country parks surrounding the city. **ABOUT THE PROGRAM** Part of the prestigious Russell Group of UK schools, this university has high-caliber academics on a large, city campus, with everything from triple-accredited business to public policy. Special classes like bagpiping make it easy to explore Scottish culture, as well as the arts, medicine, or volunteering. If the architecture looks familiar, it’s said these historic campus buildings were the inspiration for Hogwarts. And though you won’t meet wizards, with 40 percent of the university’s students from western Scotland, you’ll have many opportunities to get to know local peers. Rich in history yet plenty hip and spirited, the city of Glasgow is Scotland’s financial and cultural center. Great public transportation makes it easy to explore. You’ll want to experience Scotland’s rugged landscapes, too. Head out hiking or bouldering with the mountaineering club (the most active group on campus). With IFSA, your program also includes many cultural activities and an unforgettable Highland excursion. Explore icons like the Three Sisters peaks, Loch Ness, and Dunnottar castle, as you gain an insider’s view of the historical events that shaped this country’s history and culture. Plus, special activities give you an insider’s view of the city tourists often miss. Visit IFSA - University of Glasgow Partnership on the IFSA website for complete academic details including a list of classes and syllabi. **ACTIVITIES & EXCURSIONS** Program activities and excursions are designed to enhance your intercultural competence by developing your understanding of the local culture and people. While optional, they are included in your total program fee. Activities and excursions vary each term based on availability, but may include: 
  * City Walking Tour
  * Scottish Parliament Tour
  * Glasgow Mural and Street Art Walking-Tour
  * Ceilidh Dancing to Scottish Folk Music
  * Highlands Trip

Program Description:
**IFSA - UNIVERSITY OF ST. ANDREWS PARTNERSHIP** St Andrews, Scotland **WHY STUDY IN CITY?** St. Andrews is the quintessential university town and also full of history dating back to the sixth century. Cobbled streets link the university and the town together and help to create a strong sense of community. St. Andrews is also the world-famous home of golf. Students who have a handicap that meets the standards of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club can play on the Old Course of St. Andrews for a surprisingly reasonable fee. **ABOUT THE PROGRAM** With a history that began in 1413, it’s no wonder Scotland’s oldest university is big on traditions, like donning red academic gowns and plunging into the North Sea before exams in May. With 8,000 students, St Andrews is smaller than many UK universities, allowing for both individual attention and academics that rival Oxford and Cambridge, in everything from international relations to computer and environmental science. Themes—like Scotland, Sustainability, Travel and Exploration, Science for Arts Majors, Unique to St Andrews and Community—help visiting students find interesting classes. Plus, your Advisor of Studies will explain the academic system and help you choose your modules (classes). The school has its own marine lab (check out aquatic ecology, biology and marine science classes—including one that explores the social interactions of whales and dolphins). When it’s time for a break, meet friends on Market Street or hang out on one of the town’s three gorgeous beaches. To see more of Scotland and the UK, hop a bus to Dundee (13 miles away), where it’s an easy journey to Edinburgh or Glasgow, and four to six hours to London by train.

SIT Study Abroad Ecuador: Comparative Ecology and Conservation
Explore tropical ecosystems, conduct biological fieldwork, and study conservation in one of the world’s most biodiverse countries.
WHY STUDY CONSERVATION IN ECUADOR?
You will live like a biologist as you explore the Amazon basin, the Andes, cloud forests, Pacific Ocean coastline, and the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador—unique climatic niches that harbor ecological treasures and a plethora of flora and fauna. Within these diverse and vulnerable settings, you will conduct biological fieldwork, studying plants and insects, taking soil samples, conducting species counts, using mist nets, and observing birds. You will also have the opportunity to live with two different homestay families: in capital city of Quito and the rural cloud forest.
See for yourself the importance of Ecuador’s biota as you learn from researchers during excursions to the Andean páramo highlands, the Amazon Region, and the Cloud Forest of North-Western Ecuador. You will also spend a week exploring the Galápagos Islands by land and sea.
Hone the Spanish language skills you will need to talk about environmental and conservation issues, conduct field research, and engage in institutional and community discussions related to ecology and biology.

SIT Study Abroad Indonesia: Arts, Religion, and Social Change
Explore Indonesia’s arts, agriculture, and six officially recognized religions shaping sociocultural discourses on the side-by-side islands of Bali and Java.
WHY STUDY ARTS AND RELIGION IN INDONESIA?
Discover the astounding dynamics of a highly pluralistic society in one of the most visually arresting, culturally rich and biodiverse parts of the planet. Bali, the program base, is known for its beautiful rice terraces, beaches, temples, and distinctive art forms. Attend classes in an ancient palace. Then travel to witness Indonesia’s arts, including processions to the river, the making of tall and beautiful rice ornaments, and dance performances lasting late into the night. Explore Java’s religious sites, temples, and mosques; view street art with Javanese peers; and roam mountains. Java is the original home of tempe and batik textiles, so you will learn techniques from experts and produce a batik T-shirt. In a farming village in Bali’s Tabanan district, study the local agriculture and unique practices of the subak societies, which govern rice-field irrigation. Plant rice, cook traditional dishes, and make a coconut bowl and coconut oil. Meet healers and make medicines. Hear Indonesia’s peculiar and widely influential traditional gamelan music. Attend visual arts and ballet performances, as well as Hindu and Muslim ceremonies in Bali and Java.

# SIT Study Abroad Kenya: Global Health and Human Rights
Understand some of Kenya’s most pressing contemporary and societal challenges, including rapid urbanization, access to healthcare, and human rights. 
WHY STUDY GLOBAL HEALTH IN KENYA? Cutting-edge public health initiatives are being implemented in Kisumu, a Kenyan port city on Lake Victoria and home to the largest U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facility outside North America. The CDC’s relationship with the Kenya Medical Research Institute, which spans four decades, offers students unparalleled access to distinguished medical professionals, scholars, and scientists. Attend classes on a campus with high-speed internet and surrounded by gardens. Learn research protocol and how to gather and analyze data from experts developing improved delivery of treatments and vaccines for infectious diseases and translating findings into policy recommendations. You’ll also study Kiswahili, the lingua franca of East Africa, and gain a range of perspectives from two homestay families, one in urban Kisumu and one in the rural hills and lakes region of Siaya County. As part of the program, you will also travel to Kenya’s capital city of Nairobi, a center for relief, health, and human rights organizations, and to Rwanda, where you will survey its significantly lower rates of HIV and malaria. Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program highlights and details of coursework, educational excursions, and housing.

Experience West Africa through immersion in Ghanaian cities, which challenge stereotypes of Africa and position the continent as a global economic, political, and cultural force.
WHY STUDY GLOBALIZATION, CULTURAL LEGACIES, AND THE AFRO-CHIC IN GHANA?
From Ghana, you’ll gain a new perspective on Africa’s cosmopolitanism, one that complicates and defies Eurocentric representations that emphasize narratives of deprivation and backwardness. The central motif undergirding this program is Sankofa, a Ghanaian concept that encourages a strong engagement with the past in order to ensure informed and sustained progress into the future. You’ll also be introduced to the intricacies of hiplife music, media houses, and institutions across the country that highlight Ghana’s position in a hyper-globalized world.

Witness Nepal’s challenges in balancing tradition and modernity, while negotiating economic, political, and social change in a dynamic period of its history.
WHY STUDY SOCIAL CHANGE IN NEPAL? In the past few decades, Nepal has seen tremendous changes in development, discourse surrounding equality and inclusiveness, and human and civic rights. Live in the Kathmandu Valley, home to seven UNESCO World Heritage sites, and learn from experts, activists and academics about development, gender and social change. Visit organizations and institutions to understand how they work with government and nongovernment agencies to make meaningful change in society. Learn Nepali from expert teachers in small, dynamic classes. Connect with NGOs, INGOs, and bilateral and multilateral donors. Visit the Chitwan National Park in the plains to learn about conservation, community development and collective action. Then, trek from village to village along ancient Himalayan trade routes going as high as 13,000 feet to see community development efforts as well as Nepal’s remarkable biological, geological, and cultural diversity. In the final four weeks, research a topic of your choice while conducting independent field study, or gain professional skills in an international work environment as part of an internship.

**SIT Study Abroad Morocco: Human Rights, Social Justice, and Cultural Transformation**
Examine challenges shaping Morocco and the Arab world since the 2011 Arab Spring. Learn about human rights, social movements, and the development of individual liberties in a multicultural context. 
WHY STUDY MULTICULTURALISM IN MOROCCO? The challenges and complexities of human rights, social justice, and cultural transformations in today’s Morocco are an outgrowth of the 2011 Arab Spring that took hold throughout North Africa. These uprisings against oppression and marginalization, and the cultural shifts that followed, have expanded the demands and repertoires of current struggles in Morocco. Modern movements have grown in visibility as the state, Islamists, and activists seek to define human rights and social justice on their own terms. This program explores the present-day characteristics of the struggles for human rights and social justice within regional, national, and international contexts. We examine the resulting cultural transformations through a range of lenses including gender, individual liberties, globalization, and socioeconomic and political changes. Excursions to the north and south of the country offer a view of the systems of power and privilege that have produced inequality and unjust environmental conditions, as well as the movements and organizations that have emerged in response. We engage with social economies that cross class and gender, including women-owned businesses producing local products and re-connecting their communities to the land and the environment, and local NGOs that are working collectively to create change. Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program highlights and details of coursework, educational excursions, and housing.

**SIT Study Abroad/IHP Health and Community: Globalization, Culture, and Care**
Learn how communities around the world understand and strive for health and well-being.
WHY STUDY GLOBAL HEALTH AND COMMUNITY?
Health practices differ widely around the globe, but health inequities—between economic divides, urban and rural—are increasing exponentially everywhere. Across four continents, compare health systems and strategies, community well-being, and multiple factors affecting human health in different contexts on both local and global scales. Journey from mega-cities to rural villages to take a holistic, interdisciplinary look at how communities around the world define what it is to achieve and maintain health. With this incredible scope of experiences, you will learn to critically analyze some of the most pressing health issues of this global moment, such as social inequities, the pandemic, climate change, and the economic drivers of healthcare. You will explore individual and population health through site visits and research practice with an array of health practitioners, government officials, and activists; and you will witness how positioning health as a human right impacts policy and health outcomes at all levels. Finally, explore the challenges all citizens face amid mounting obstacles to healthcare access, while strengthening your ability to understand, interpret, and compare the sociocultural, ecological, economic, political, and biological factors that shape and predict human health.

# **SIT Study Abroad Tanzania: Wildlife Conservation and Political Ecology**
Explore the balance between ecological concerns and socioeconomic objectives in the vast wilderness expanses of northern Tanzania.
WHY STUDY CONSERVATION AND ECOLOGY TANZANIA?
Tanzania is a beautiful and diverse country, home to the Serengeti Plains, Mount Kilimanjaro, and the Zanzibar archipelago. You’ll spend 30 nights camping in these wilderness areas to see the variety of Tanzania’s landscapes and wildlife, including lions, zebras, elephants, and a range of bird species including ostriches and Kori bustards. As you learn ecological field techniques and national park management, you’ll see how human development and population growth affect natural habitats and vice versa. You’ll learn to reframe notions of sustainability in relation to local population needs, perspectives, and values.
In addition to wildlife ecology, you will study Tanzanian history, political ecology, economics, and current events. You’ll learn how to integrate both social science and ecological field techniques through anthropological and field ecology projects. The program has several major in-country partners: Sokoine University of Agriculture, the College of African Wildlife Management-Mweka, Klub Afriko Cultural Orientation Center, and the host communities. Many students have returned to work with these partners in future endeavors.

SIT Study Abroad/IHP Climate Change: The Politics Land, Water & Energy Justice
Travel across four continents to witness the causes and social impacts of climate change and examine possibilities for local and global environmental justice.
WHY A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CLIMATE CHANGE?
Explore some of the world’s most productive and vulnerable landscapes to witness how climate change impacts regions differently and how communities are responding to the climate crisis. In four cultural and socio-ecological contexts, you’ll analyze the challenges of working toward more equitable food, water, and energy policies. Examine the problems and possible solutions with researchers, farmers, activists, social entrepreneurs, non-governmental organizations, and policymakers. In Morocco’s Atlas Mountains, you’ll meet farmers striving to modernize their agricultural practices and understand how the country, which has few fossil fuels, is embracing renewable energy. In Nepal, you will be uniquely located in a country that is vulnerable to climate change but has numerous initiatives to tackle this global challenge. The course here will offer a chance to interact with numerous experts, communities, and institutions across the Nepalese Himalayas. In Peru, you will discuss and envision a world where traditional cultural knowledge and indigenous epistemologies shape the way we work for a more just and sustainable future.

SIT Study Abroad/IHP Human Rights: Movements, Power, and Resistance
Investigate the historical and social contexts of human rights movements, including the roles of culture, identity, political economy, and international law.
### WHY A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF HUMAN RIGHTS?
Go beyond the halls of power to learn how individuals and communities are giving momentum to grassroots, human rights movements across four countries. Connect with groups working for immigrant and gender rights and against structural racism in New York City, and critically examine the deep roots of human rights movements throughout the United States. Travel next to Nepal, Jordan, and Chile, where you’ll meet with scholars, members of Parliament, feminist leaders, staff of international non-governmental organizations, United Nations officials, indigenous community members, and refugees. Gain deeper insight into multilayered perspectives on human rights, often against the backdrop of governments in tectonic shift, and understand pathways to enacting human rights-based change. Explore how COVID-19 has shifted the conversations on human rights and highlighted global economic inequity. Along the way, you’ll explore how to live, act, teach, and learn in ways that affirm human dignity, uproot oppression, and advance collective struggles for rights and justice everywhere.

## Tokyo - Language & Culture
#### Program Overview
Expand your understanding of Japan by immersing yourself in contemporary Japan and its culture—and what better way to learn the Japanese language? At Kanda University of International Studies (KUIS), you take a 6-credit language course specially designed for IES Abroad students (with the option of taking up to 12 credits of language), plus area studies courses taught in English. The English-language course offerings look at Japan from the point of view of popular culture, history, politics, and the arts. Founded in 1987, KUIS is a private university dedicated to the pursuit of excellence in International Studies, Foreign Languages, Intercultural Communication, Japanese Culture, and Linguistics.
Tokyo will be your classroom. Visit Tokyo’s traditional hot spots, like the temple at Asakusa, the gardens of the Imperial Palace, and the Meiji Grand Shrine. You can also learn about Tokyo’s younger generations by visiting popular districts like Shibuya, Shinjuku, Akihabara, and Harajuku.
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.
#### Why Tokyo?
Explore centuries-old temples, gardens, and castles that are only minutes from ultra-modern skyscrapers, electronics stores, and haute couture fashion centers. Dine on sushi and tempura, attend a sumo match or a baseball game, and learn tea ceremony, karate, or breakdancing. Take classes in the town of Makuhari, on the tip of Tokyo Bay, and just 45 minutes from the heart of the city. All of this and so much more awaits you in Tokyo!

Program Description:
**IFSA - Queen Mary, University of London** London, England **WHY STUDY IN CITY?** London is one of the most cosmopolitan cities in the world and one of the most popular study abroad destinations. A sophisticated city with endless cultural, historic, artistic, political, and intellectual offerings, it’s also home to many universities scattered throughout different neighborhoods. London’s excellent public transportation system will take you easily from your housing to classes and anywhere else you want to go. The city’s train stations, bus networks, and airports make traveling throughout the UK and Europe a snap. **ABOUT THE PROGRAM** Queen Mary, University of London is one of the UK’s leading research-focused universities, and one of the largest University of London colleges. Its flexible system allows you to choose classes from different academic departments across the university. IFSA students in this program live and learn at the fully integrated campus at Mile End, part of London’s historic East End district. Campus is surrounded by vibrant neighborhoods, including Brick Lane and Shoreditch, which are both fashionable and rich in history. Two underground stations, Mile End and Stepney Green, provide quick, easy access to the city. With a student body of more than 33,000 that includes 2,800 from outside the UK, Queen Mary is known for a strong sense of community and a commitment to academic success. High-caliber academics include strong business and science programs. Rare on-campus housing and 300+ clubs make it easy to join in at the Russell Group’s most inclusive university. Before class, grab one of London’s best bagels, first sold in the East End by Jewish immigrants in the 1880s. Later, look for vintage finds at Brick Lane shops, unwind at Victoria Park, or scramble on 16K square feet of vertical at Mile End Climbing Wall. Your program also includes IFSA excursions and activities (no extra fees) that give you insights tourists often miss. Possibilities include a West End theater performance, a session in the famous The Great British Bake Off tent, and exploring below ground with a former coal miner in Wales.

Program Description:
Multilateral efforts like the United Nations High Seas Treaty are on the forefront of modern biodiversity protection. Oceans may contain more than one million species, however, less than one-quarter of these have been identified. Marine biodiversity has the potential to transform medicine, industry, environmental remediation, and energy production, but is threatened by pollution, habitat destruction, over-fishing, and climate change. Studying organisms beyond national boundaries is crucial to understanding and conserving our ocean ecosystems. Using the same portable next generation sequencing platform employed on the International Space Station and in both the Arctic and Antarctic wilderness, students enrolled in SEA’s Marine Biodiversity & Conservation Program learn how to use modern molecular tools to ask and answer ecological and conservation questions as they sail from New Zealand to Tahiti. Traversing a range of bioregions, including temperate, blue water, and tropical, students will collect zooplankton specimens from the mesopelagic (the Ocean Twilight Zone), and conduct group research projects addressing population genomics and biodiversity. Students will examine how these ecosystems are responding to climate change, and gain an understanding of how such research informs conservation policy. The MBC program along this cruise track is planned as a long-term and much needed data set that can help shape conservation in the Pacific. The program ends in Tahiti with a two-week second shore component and student-led symposium with local stakeholders, scientists, and conservationists. The Marine Biodiversity & Conservation program is geared toward students interested in in ocean science as a career, as well as those interested in marine ecology and conservation, molecular biology, or environmental marine policy.

### Academics
Students arrive in Heidelberg six weeks before the actual start of the university semester, allowing them time for a preliminary course designed to prepare students for the University Language Proficiency Exam (DSH). Nearly all undergraduate courses at Universität Heidelberg are taught in German, so the DSH exam plays a major role in determining which courses are suited for you. Once students have taken the DSH exam, they will have a week break. Aside from the mandatory preliminary course, students enroll in four additional courses, or three courses and an academic internship. Most courses earn three U.S. credits. Occasionally, a course might have a tutorial or a lab earning an additional credit. Your total number of credits as a full year student will be 30-32 credits. Read more about academic options.
### Program & Semester Dates
Universität Heidelberg, like all German universities runs on a semester system with two semesters per year, Wintersemester (October - February) and Sommersemester (April - July). In order to accommodate American students from both, semester and term-based schools, AJY offers two fall semester options. Other options include a full academic year, spring semester or our Summer Program. No matter which option students choose, they will earn between 15-16 academic credits per semester. Read more about academic options.
### Student Life
The sooner you are involved in activities in the local community, the more exciting and rewarding your time in Heidelberg is. The possibilities are limited only by your imagination. All students receive a five-day German Rail Pass for either fall or spring break. AJY student rooms are located in university dormitories throughout the city or in private dormitories for students only. Meals can be eaten in the cafeterias near the AJY Study Center, or you may choose to eat at one of the many restaurants in Old Town around University Square. Read more about Student Life.

### Budapest
Budapest, a city of two million, is situated on both sides of the river Duna (Danube). Eight graceful bridges link the charming hills of Buda on the river's west bank to cosmopolitan Pest on the east. The construction of the Royal Palace on Buda's Castle Hill was begun over 700 years ago. Actually, the history of this district dates even earlier; a thousand years before the Hungarian kings, Roman warriors maintained a military settlement there to guard the "limes" of the Empire. Buda and Pest were united in 1872 and the union grew into the friendly metropolis we see now in modern Budapest with its elegant boulevards, coffeehouses, and concert halls. 
### Hungary
Hungary is a small country, about the size of Indiana. Its population is 10 million. Located in Central Europe, it is bordered by Slovakia on the north, Ukraine and Romania on the east, Slovenia, Croatia, and Serbia to the south, and Austria on the west. Hungary had a turbulent past. The country was invaded and was under foreign domination for much of the second half of its 1100-year history. Defying numerous conquerors, Hungary has maintained a distinct language and culture. **Academics**
  * Classes are taught in English
  * Classes meet two hours per day, four days a week
  * Classes are small with a focus on problem-solving, student creativity, and group learning.


### **Course Offerings**
From our usual course selection, we offer four full courses plus the research option(s) in the summer. These are
  1. the introductory level Abstract Algebra
  2. a Conjecture and Proof/ Mathematical Problem Solving course (the level of the course will be set according to the background of the audience)
  3. an advanced analysis: our Real Functions and Measures course
  4. a combinatorics course: CO1/ CO2 (its level will be set according to the background of the audience)

**Location** **Berlin, Germany -- Vienna, Austria** **Population:** 3,400,000 -- 1,700,000 **Local Time:**Central European Time **Weather:**Berlin & Vienna **Known For:** For hundreds of years, Berlin and Vienna have competed for the title of preeminent Germanic cultural and political metropole. Nowadays, the two capital cities - strikingly different from one another - continue to be the preeminent cultural and political capitals of their respective countries. Berlin, forced by the destruction of World War II to rebuild itself in two different ways and under two radically different political systems, is awash with mid-century, international style structures on the west and immense, concrete apartment structures in the east; Berlin is trendy and vibrant, embracing grit and informality despite its other role as the political heart of the Eurozone's most powerful member. Vienna, on the other hand, wows at first glimpse with regal Pracht, the self-evident former capital of a large, European empire. Its cobblestone-lined alleys spiral outward from its historical heart to the grand, circular _Ringstrasse_ - lined with 19th century government buildings and stately homes. Despite their differences, however, both cities play host to an array of diplomats and expatriates, international students and immigrants. **> > Good to Know:**
  * Study Location: 
    * In Berlin, students study at the Goethe Institut's location in the Hackescher Markt neighborhood of former East Berlin, just north of Alexanderplatz.
    * In Vienna: 
      * students' program courses are offered at the charming first district home of the Austro-American Institute, located across the street from the eastern side of the famous Vienna Staatsoper.

Program Description:
# **SIT Study Abroad Serbia, Austria, & Hungary: Comparative European Perspectives on Conflict & Democracy**
**Study peacebuilding, post-conflict transformation, and the impact of international intervention and political transition in three southeast European countries.**
WHY STUDY PEACE AND DEMOCRACY IN SERBIA, HUNGARY, AND AUSTRIA? Analyze the continent’s most pressing sociopolitical and economic challenges—including the war on Ukraine—and how they intersect with issues of mass migration, refugee crises, and the rise of far-right nationalism and populism. You will examine the threat of illiberal democracies on the future of political organizing and evaluate impacts of civic engagement and social movements from the streets of large urban centers, where everyday citizens are demanding change.
The program’s base is the city of Belgrade, the largest urban and political center of southeast Europe known for its vibrant culture and nightlife. There, you will examine European perspectives on conflict and democracy through the lenses of EU member and non-member states, and grassroots and social movements that include Ukrainian refugees and Russians who fled to Belgrade to avoid the draft.
In Belgrade and during excursions to Budapest and Vienna, you will engage with EU policymakers to learn about an array of political agendas, local activist movements, and regional identities within the shifting power relations of contemporary Europe. During a day trip to Bratislava, Slovakia, become immersed in the cultural life of this beautiful and compelling central European country. Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program highlights and details of coursework, educational excursions, and housing.

**SIT Study Abroad South Africa: International Relations in the Global South**
Explore non-western perspectives on South-South and continental relations through lectures, visits, and internships involving diplomats, activists, and intellectuals in South Africa and Mozambique.
WHY STUDY INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS IN THE GLOBAL SOUTH?
This program offers an opportunity to learn non-western perspectives in the fields of international and South-South relations and to examine broad policy questions in sub-Saharan Africa through the lenses of youth employment, conflict, and poverty. An introduction to South African politics sets the groundwork for the program focus on international relations and foreign policy, providing an opportunity for you to engage in major contemporary debates in the Global South.
We examine the African Union and other continental influencers including international organizations and non-state actors, and we look at how BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) has emerged as an alternative power block on the global political stage. Central to the program is the opportunity to intern at an internationally acclaimed NGO such as the Africa Centre for the Constructive Resolution of Disputes (ACCORD), the Institute for Global Dialogue (IGD), Institute for Security Studies (ISS), or the South African Institute of International Affairs.
You will visit the Luthuli Museum, former home of the first Black Nobel Prize winner, and the home of Mahatma Gandhi, whose political consciousness was shaped in South Africa. Learn about the role of NGOs in international relations on excursions to Cape Town and Maputo, Mozambique, which offered frontline state solidarity to South Africa during apartheid.

# _SIT Study Abroad South Africa: Multiculturalism and Human Rights_
Examine historical and contemporary multiculturalism, ethnicity, and identity in South Africa.
WHY STUDY HEALTH IN SOUTH AFRICA?
South Africa has made legislative strides in righting the wrongs of apartheid, but significant challenges remain. Historically, colonial and apartheid racial discrimination policies categorized people according to race, including Bantu (Black), Coloured (those who were not categorized as Bantu or white) and the minority white. Law created a racial hierarchy with white people at the top of the pyramid, and diminishing rights, access and “human-ness” moving down the hierarchy, which placed Coloured people as a buffer between those categorized as white and black. The cleavages of this legacy remain evident in the lived realities of South Africans.
Starting from your base in Cape Town, you’ll learn how race relations continue to be shaped by a range of contested histories, politics, resistance, activism, and the deployment of rights-based rhetoric. Journey to key sites such as the Steve Biko Centre, where you will study the Black Consciousness Movement, and Robben Island, the prison that held the late South African President Nelson Mandela. You will experience South Africa through the eyes of diverse homestay families in city and rural locations.
Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program courses (including syllabi), educational excursions, and housing.

Our staff provides expert advice on acquiring an internship before your arrival. Focus on your long-term professional development and reflect on your experiences in the accompanying academic course. The Washington Semester Program is an academic experiential learning program for students who, at the time they participate in the Program, will be at least in their second semester of their second year of college. It includes 8 credits of academic seminar in one of 12 topic areas, 4 credits of internship, and the option of taking an additional 3-4 credits of independent research or an elective course. The seminar will give you the chance to meet professionals who are chest-deep in the fields you are studying so that you gain valuable expert insights first-hand. At your internship, you'll get real-world work experience while making connections with leaders in Washington, D.C. The research project or elective course lets you take your experience one step further and use the valuable resources that AU and Washington, D.C. have to offer.
### Core Components
Seminar (8 Credits) For three days of each week, you'll participate in intellectual discussion with professionals who are knee-deep in the field you are studying. You'll go "behind the scenes"; into the offices of most of the speakers to get a first-hand insider's view of the week's topics of discussion. Some of the speakers are big names and some are not, but one thing's certain, they are all major players at the local, national, and international levels who are passionate about their stance, present valid viewpoints and are invited to challenge your point of view. You'll definitely leave class with a real world perspective. The Internship (4 Credits*) We provide you with an instant network of organizations to look through. Six to eight weeks before the semester begins, you'll gain access to all of the internships in our database that are relevant to the program into which you have been accepted. We'll give you all the information you need about each organization, including descriptions of internship positions and address and phone numbers for our contacts. You can start your search right away, or wait until you arrive in D.C. Either way, you'll have nearly two weeks at the beginning of the semester to attend interviews and make your selection. We suggest you have at least three interviews. Before you arrive, we will also provide you with resources to help you write an effective résumé and cover letter. *Note that the Public Health track has a 6-credit internship component.

Program Description:
Our oceans play a critical role in understanding our planet’s climate system and the effects a warming planet will have on global climate patterns. Understanding climate change and its associated impacts is the critical scientific challenge of today, and the timely application of this knowledge to public policy is crucial to the future of our planet. This intensive semester invites students to develop their understanding of the oceans’ role in climate dynamics and to build their tool-kit in research, data visualization, and science communication; skills all climate scientists must have in order to be effective advocates for our oceans. Students participating in Oceans & Climate will conduct baseline climate research on this long sailing passage, and the potential projects open for investigation are diverse. Oceans & Climate’s voyage comprises of an extended blue-water transect from Fiji to Aotearoa New Zealand, allowing students to explore a range of ecosystems each characterized by distinctive biological communities and complex and dynamic current systems. The transfer of carbon through the coupled ocean/atmosphere system is influenced by many attributes this program can investigate, so our voyage track becomes an excellent natural laboratory for studying almost all aspects of oceanic carbon cycling. SEA’s Oceans & Climate program allows students to develop the skills required for a professional career in the field of climate change research and communication.

Housing Options:  |  Dormitory  |  Academic Area:  |  Biology, Ecology, Environmental Studies   
Program Description:
The Semester in Environmental Science is a 15-week fall semester at the Ecosystems Center of the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. The curriculum provides an intensive field and laboratory-based introduction to ecosystem science and the biogeochemistry of coastal forests, freshwater ponds and estuaries. The curriculum leads students to develop research questions of their own. Equipped with new knowledge and techniques learned in the first weeks of the semester, they pursue independent research during the last six weeks of the program. SESÂ students report their findings at a final symposium that is open to the entire Woods Hole scientific community, a world center for marine and environmental sciences. **THE CORE COURSES** The SES program emphasizes learning by doing -- students spend over 20 hours each week in the lab and field investigating forests, ponds and estuaries on Cape Cod. Virtually all ecosystems have been impacted by human activity, and so this is also a curriculum about how human-caused changes in the environment are affecting the globe. Core course lecturescover both**aquatic** and**terrestrial ecosystems** from the point of view of biogeochemistry and important ecological processes. Course research takes place in local ecosystems -- ponds and estuaries within the Waquoit Bay watershed adjacent to Vineyard Sound, West Falmouth Harbor on Buzzards Bay, and the town forest at the municipal sewage treatment plant. **ELECTIVES** In addition to the Core Courses, SES students take one elective which meets twice a week. The elective is intended to deepen understanding in a specific sub-discipline of ecosystems science. Choose from: 
  * Aquatic Chemistry,
  * Ecosystems Dynamics,
  * Global Ecology,
  * Human-dominated Ecosystems,
  * Mathematical Modeling,
  * Microbial Methods

**PROJECTS** The structured laboratory experiences and techniques of the core courses and electives set the stage for the most rewarding part of the SES program, the projects. During the last five weeks of the course, students will be able to devote full time to a project of their choosing. **DISTINGUISHED SCIENTIST SEMINAR SERIES** A number of distinguished scientists are invited to give lectures and meet with SES students each year. It is an opportunity for students to hear from some of the country's top practitioners and to find out about their research and current concerns. During the visit of each of these scientists, the SES students are able to question them closely about everything from basic science to environmental problems to the availability of graduate programs. **SCIENCE WRITING SEMINAR** SES students all take part in a seminar that introduces the art of science writing. This is taught by our writer-in-residence and several professional science journalists with the goal of illustrating how the results of scientific investigations can be transmitted to the larger reading audience in ways that catch their interest and educate. Students will write a profile of one of the distinguished scientists based on an interview. With this and other programs at the Marine Biological Laboratory, we hope to begin training a new generation of writers conversant in science who can communicate about critical environmental issues with the public. **Prerequisites** Because of the diversity of curricula at the schools participating in the Environmental Science Consortium, we are providing a description of the knowledge we hope students will have, rather than specific course requirements. We have grouped these under three categories: Biological Science, Chemistry and Mathematics. Students who are deficient in a given area may still qualify for entrance in the program at the discretion of the on-campus advisor and selection committee.

## Nantes - French Language Immersion & Area Studies
#### Program Overview
Nantes is well-known for being a charming city in which to live in France, and it's quite easy to see why. Home to many young professionals and students, there are plenty of new friends to make and an active nightlife waiting for you in Nantes. Once the capital of Brittany, Nantes has a rich history, which you can see firsthand by visiting the Cathédrale St-Pierre et St-Paul and the Château des Ducs de Bretagne. It's also easy to walk around and explore the city by foot.
The IES Abroad Nantes Program has two important goals: to improve your written and verbal proficiency in French through language and area studies courses and teaching internships, and to introduce you to contemporary France and its role in the European Union. Founded in 1965, the program is small enough to welcome you into the community, yet large enough to allow for a variety of academic and extracurricular activities. We offer you the opportunity to integrate fully into French society and function completely in French, due to the program's focus on full immersion and the fact that there are few Anglophones in Nantes.
This program enjoys a close relationship with the Université de Nantes. You have access to the school's libraries, computer labs, cafeterias, and sports facilities, and are welcome to join student clubs and other social and sports organizations. You also have many opportunities for enrolling in university courses. IES Abroad courses are taught in French by native French faculty, many of whom are professors at the Université de Nantes. You select from IES Abroad language and area studies courses, and can add a teaching internship and university courses to complete your schedule.
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.
#### Why Nantes?
Imagine yourself stopping by the 15th century Château des Ducs, exploring fine arts museums, enjoying a crêpe in a quaint café, and walking along the Loire River in this quintessential French town. It's the sixth largest city in France, but quaint enough to feel at home. Did we mention the food is divine? Discover the F _rench joie de vivre_ when you study abroad in Nantes.
#### Student Life
We strive to make sure you feel safe, cared for, and at home while you’re away from home. Whether it’s the orientation program that makes you feel prepared, your housing that is well-located and comfortable, the cultural events that make it easy and fun to meet other international and local students, or the field trips and walking tours that take you to places tourists don’t usually see—we’re all about our student service.

## Galápagos Islands Direct Enrollment - GAIAS
#### Program Overview
There's a reason why some of the world's most famous scientists have visited the Galápagos Islands—now it's your turn to discover one of the world's most beautiful and biologically-diverse island locations. It's here that you will get hands-on experience studying topics such as Biology, Ecology, Environmental Studies, Marine Ecology, and Sociology.
This direct enrollment program is organized through the Galápagos Academic Institute for the Arts and Sciences (GAIAS), a remote campus of the Universidad San Francisco de Quito (USFQ) located on the island of San Cristobal. Before you head to the Galápagos, the program will begin with a month in Quito, where you participate in an orientation, classes at USFQ, and field study excursions. The remaining months are spent on San Cristobal in the Galápagos Islands, although additional field study excursions allow you to spend time in other locations, as determined by your chosen track: Evolution, Ecology and Conservation; Marine Ecology; or People, Politics, and the Environment.
The Galápagos Islands and Quito will be your classroom. Witness the famous land iguanas and giant tortoises as you study the evolution of these unique species. Visit indigenous and traditional Andean communities to better understand the relationship between humans and their environment. Dive into the Pacific to get close to the marine life you will be learning about. Welcome to study abroad!
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.
#### Why the Galápagos Islands?
The Galápagos Islands hold endless wonders of natural beauty. Imagine stepping foot onto this mysterious dark land knowing it's an estimated 3.5 million years old. Yes, million. This environmental haven awaits you 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador—complete with sea lions, iguanas, and tortoises galore waiting to welcome you.

Academic Area:  |  Geology   
Program Description:
The Geology of New Zealand Programme (Geology) begins with a five-week field camp, which includes a series of interlinked modules that explore the stratigraphy, mountain building, and tectonics of the South Island, and the volcanology and geothermal geology of the North Island. Following field-camp, students transition to a campus semester at the University of Canterbury located in Christchurch on New Zealand’s South Island. While at the University of Canterbury, students enroll in four courses, one of which is a research methods course based upon data collected in field camp. **Field Camp Spring Semester: January 9th – February 13th, 2017 Field Camp Fall Semester: June 7th – July 15th, 2017** For 5.5 weeks, students will travel throughout the North and South Islands, deciphering the geologic evolution of New Zealand from a series of linked field modules. Our goal is to provide students with a skill base of field-focused techniques that will enable them to understand the fundamental causes and timescales of geologic processes. Field work is complemented by map preparation and exercises in the evenings, as well as lectures that highlight a wide variety of our staff’s field and laboratory-based studies. **2017 field modules (modules subject to change):**
  * **Field Module 1: Introduction to Geologic Field Mapping in Castle Hills Basin.** The first component of field camp is an introduction to field mapping in the Castle Hill Basin, located in the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps, inland Canterbury. Students will learn basic field skills including compass work and navigation, triangulating for location, field notetaking and sketching, outcrop descriptions, introduction to geomorphological observations, and producing a small geologic map.
  * **Field Module 2: Detailed stratigraphic and structural mapping in an uplifted and deformed succession of Oligocene marine strata (Castle Hill basin).** The second module examines the stratigraphy and structural geology of Castle Hill basin, located in the eastern foothills of the Southern Alps, inland Canterbury. This part of the course will focus on advanced field mapping skills, including the compilation of a detailed stratigraphic column, mapping geological contacts and structures, geomorphic features, and preparing geological cross sections. The structural mapping concentrates on the complex folding best expressed by a middle Tertiary limestone unit, and we will be developing a structure contour map on this unit. This will develop an understanding of both the structural and geomorphic evolution of the basin, and subsequent uplift, deformation and glaciations.
  * **Field Module 3: Gondwanaland to New Zealand: reconstructing the geologic architecture of the South Island.** Field module 3 integrates different types of geologic data to interpret a geologic history of the Buller District of the West Coast region, South Island. This part of the field programme is based in Westport. This model focuses on the examination of a metamorphic core complex, its less deformed cover and contemporaneous basin deposits reflecting the Cretaceous Gondwana breakup and related extension. Additionally, we will study the tectonic controls on the formation and evolution of the Cretaceous-Tertiary basins of the region, and how this has been subsequently folded and faulted. The field programme provides further field training utilizing and developing basic field mapping skills such as the observation, recording and interpretation of folded bedding-cleavage relationships, and furthers structural relationships at varying scales.
  * **Field Module 4: Volcanoes: Eruption Styles, Volcano Monitoring and Hazards.** Large stratovolcanoes are what come to mind when one typically imagines a volcano. In this module, students will learn how these types of volcanoes are constructed over time, the scale of the different eruption types and their resulting volcanic deposits, the frequency of eruptions, and what happens to these volcanoes when they are not erupting. In addition, students will learn about the associated hazards of the these volcanoes and put their newfound mapping skills and volcanic knowledge to the test in a an eruption simulation exercise.
  * **Field Module 5: Independent Research Projects.** During field module 5, students will apply the skills acquired during the first four weeks of field camp to group mapping projects of previously unmapped terrain on Banks Peninsula. This is the capstone field camp experience that leads into the initiation of your semester research project during this last field module. Research projects in 2017 could involve volcanology, igneous petrology, geomorphology, paleoclimatology, digital mapping (GIS and 3-D visualisation), geo-archaeology, geologic hazards, engineering geology, and geo-education.

**Spring Campus Semester: February 17th – June 24th, 2017 Fall Campus Semester: July 15th – November 13th, 2016** The field camp experience will transition into a semester at the University of Canterbury. Students will enroll in 4 semester courses (2 Geology courses including a required research methods course, and 2 course of your choosing from the University of Canterbury course catalogue). The research methods course allows the students to conduct a research project based upon data collected during field camp. In addition, students will learn to compile and prepare a professional map and geologic history based on field module 1

Program Description:
## Salamanca - Language & Area Studies
#### Program Overview
Add the atmosphere of a university town and the hospitality and charm of a small city and you have Salamanca. Declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1988, Salamanca is the most important university city in Spain and is known for its contributions to Spanish language education.
The program is closely linked to the academic and social life of the Universidad de Salamanca (USAL), the oldest university in Spain and one of the most prestigious in Europe. Learn alongside your Spanish peers by enrolling in at least one class at USAL or the Universidad Pontificia de Salamanca (UPSA). Regardless of your major, you may combine your interests in linguistic and cultural proficiency with your academic pursuits.
#### Why Salamanca?
Stroll through Salamanca's Old City (a UNESCO World Heritage Site!), and you'll get lost in the beauty of the aged architecture, like the Baroque styling of the Plaza Mayor in the heart of the city. Many people flock to this university town because Salamancans' Spanish is one of the easiest to understand, making it easy for you to communicate and experience a full immersion into the Spanish culture.
#### Student Life
We strive to make sure you feel safe, cared for, and at home while you’re away from home. Whether it’s the orientation program that makes you feel prepared, your housing that is well-located and comfortable, the cultural events that make it easy and fun to meet other international and local students, or the field trips and walking tours that take you to places tourists don’t usually see—we’re all about our student service. Learn more about the day-to-day studying abroad on this program. From field trips to housing, it’s all on IES Abroad’s website. **Get started.**
#### Scholarships & aid
IES Abroad firmly believes that financial limitations should not prevent a qualified student from participating in an IES Abroad program. That's why we commit $6 million in study abroad scholarships and aid, all offered through one quick and easy application. **Aid Application Deadlines** : Summer – April 1 Fall/Academic Year – May 1 Spring/Calendar Year – November 1
#### The IES Abroad difference

# **SIT Study Abroad Tanzania: Zanzibar Coastal Ecology and Natural Resource Management**
Explore ecology, natural resource management and sustainability in Tanzania-Zanzibar, on the islands of Unguja, Mafia, and Pemba in the Western Indian Ocean, and mainland Tanzania.

Zanzibar’s extensive shoreline, unique flora and fauna, and tropical climate are ideal for exploring conservation and management of coral reefs, inter-tidal zones, and tropical forests. From your coastal base in Stone Town, a UNESCO World Heritage site, gain a deeper understanding of biodiversity, conservation areas, and ecotourism projects. Study rare or endemic species such as the whale shark, Pemba flying fox, and Zanzibar red colobus monkey. Meet officials at Zanzibar’s Department of Forestry and the Institute of Marine Sciences to hear their perspectives on natural resource management. Learn and practice speaking Kiswahili during your homestays in Stone Town, Zanzibar, and on Pemba Island. Understand the techniques, methods, and ethics necessary for successful field research, and partner with experts on an independent study project of your choice. Examine issues in marine and coastal environments through short excursions. Observe wildlife while snorkeling off of Bawe. Chumbe, Kwale, Mafia, and Misali islands. You’ll also visit Pange Reef and Sandbar. 
Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program courses (including syllabi), educational excursions, and housing.

## Multi-Location – Emerging Economies: Buenos Aires & Santiago
#### Program Overview
Learn about the accelerated pace of globalization and economic growth of two very distinct cultures when you spend a semester in Buenos Aires and Santiago. Both serve as models for both the pitfalls and opportunities surrounding emerging economies in transition within the global marketplace.
The program begins with orientation in Buenos Aires, where the first half of the program is held, followed by a week-long, course-related trip to Peru, and the second half of the program in Santiago.
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.
#### Why Buenos Aires & Santiago?
Studying abroad in Santiago and Buenos Aires will turn these locations in global classrooms. Imagine visiting Chilean local business organizations as part of your study of regional and global trade. Or meeting business professionals in Buenos Aires, who can speak to you first-hand about how the city is poised to emerge as one Latin America's strongest economies following the implementation of new fiscal policies and restructuring of debt. All of this is possible when you spend a semester in Buenos Aires and Santiago.
#### Student Life
We strive to make sure you feel safe, cared for, and at home while you’re away from home.

SIT Study Abroad Chile: Public Health, Traditional Medicine, and Community Empowerment
Learn about public health through traditional medicine and intercultural health practices, indigenous customs, community welfare, and social justice.
WHY STUDY PUBLIC HEALTH IN CHILE?
Live in ethnically diverse Arica, Chile, home to many cultural worldviews and health practices as well as unequal access to health services. From this strategic location near the borders of Peru and Bolivia, you’ll learn about transnational issues such as infectious disease management and examine healthcare from international perspectives at health centers and government offices. You’ll also learn how to collect, analyze, integrate, and report social and public health data, and use that knowledge while completing independent research or an internship.
You will have the opportunity to learn firsthand about the work carried out by public health teams of Chilean Health System to combat COVID-19, their successful vaccination programs, challenges, and lessons learned.
During excursions, you will spend more than two weeks with Mapuche and Aymara communities, where you’ll learn about indigenous and intercultural medicine and examine how healthcare policies and politics affect indigenous people. Throughout the program, you’ll engage with health officials, policy makers, and traditional medicine practitioners and have homestays with three different families in both urban and rural areas.
You will also develop Spanish language skills related to health sciences through classroom learning, cultural immersion, homestays, and excursions.

SIT Study Abroad Chile: Cultural Identity, Social Justice, and Community Development
Explore Chile’s recent political and social history and how Chileans are reconciling with the past to create a more equitable and culturally inclusive society.

Chile has undergone monumental political, economic, and social changes over the past four decades—including transitioning away from a 17-year dictatorship. Studying in Chile, you will explore how Chileans today are building a more equitable and inclusive nation and you will become part of a larger intercultural movement yourself. You’ll witness the struggle for justice and reconciliation related to the military regime’s human rights violations, and you will have the opportunity to complete an internship or conduct independent research.
During your excursions, you will spend two weeks with Mapuche and Aymara communities to understand the longstanding challenges Chile’s indigenous peoples face. In addition, you’ll work on a community project with an NGO and learn about the development strategies local communities are using to confront their unique challenges.
You will also receive intensive Spanish language instruction and develop the skills to discuss sociocultural issues through classroom learning, cultural immersion, homestays, and excursions.

**Student Life** The Augsburg CGEE Study Center in Mexico, nicknamed "Casa Augsburg," is a 15-minute walk from downtown Cuernavaca and the main city plaza, in the neighborhood of San Antón. CGEE is well established in San Antón and has many friends and close connections in the neighborhood, including many of the homestay families. Casa Augsburg is located at the top of one of the large ravines that runs through the city, offering a dramatic view from the nearby bridge that leads to downtown. Because of the ravine, there is a 100-foot waterfall right in the neighborhood, a local eco-tourist attraction. Right across the bridge, students will find a large public garden/park, an independent movie theater, the Cathedral, and several popular cafés. This program includes regional travel (included in the program fee). Weekend excursions includes locations such as: Puebla, Teotihuacan, Toluca, a volcano, and a natural water park. Seminars and homestays in rural Indigenous communities, and a short seminar in Mexico City are also included. **Student Life** This program is ideal for anyone whose career goals include working with immigrant populations in the U.S. and/or as grassroots activists or working internationally. Learning from direct contact with grassroots groups working for social change, especially indigenous, feminist, and LGBTQ+ leaders will be an invaluable asset for anyone interested in graduate studies in related fields.

## Freiburg - Environmental Studies & Sustainability
#### Program Overview
The environmental movement took root in Freiburg long ago–and now it's a way of life. Known for taking the lead in the development of eco-friendly technologies and architecture, Freiburg also attracts researchers and environmental organizations from around the world. Come study Freiburg's many unique contributions to this important movement, while simultaneously benefiting from the city's location near the beautiful Black Forest and Rhine River Valley.
This English-taught program allows you to explore topics in Environmental Studies, Forest Ecology, and Sustainability while living in Freiburg, a well-known center for environmental innovation. Freiburg and the surrounding regions will be your classroom. Can you imagine traveling to the Rhine River Valley to take samples and observe local ecology; or traveling to the forests of the Swiss Alps to further your discussions on forest management and tourism? Welcome to study abroad! Wherever possible, your courses take you outside the classroom to give you hands-on experience and to take advantage of all that your study abroad location has to offer.
In addition to Environmental Studies topics, you have the opportunity to study German language at the beginning, intermediate, or advanced level at the Sprachlehrinstitut (SLI) of the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.
#### Why Freiburg?
It is impossible not to fall in love with Freiburg. Maybe it's the curving cobblestone streets, medieval architecture, and beautiful cathedral. Or maybe it's the city's progressive mindset--Freiburg shows a remarkable commitment to the environment and the development of sustainable technologies. Either way, we invite you to study abroad in Freiburg and discover all there is to love about this enchanting university town.

SIT Study Abroad Australia: Sustainability and Environmental Action
Surrounded by the inspiring beauty of Australia’s World Heritage areas, investigate sustainable ways of protecting the environment and promoting equality. 
WHY STUDY SUSTAINABILITY IN AUSTRALIA?
With poor soils, unique organisms, and a climate governed largely by El Niño, Australia has keenly felt the effects of climate change. From your base two blocks from the beach in the small coastal town of Byron Bay, you’ll explore Australia’s burgeoning permaculture and sustainable farming initiatives. During excursions and workshops, including ten days in Tasmania, a sustainable urban design workshop in Melbourne, and a five-day camping trip with Aboriginal elders, you’ll meet environmental activists, see examples of successful campaigns, and get tools to apply sustainability efforts at home.
You’ll spend much of the program in the field. In each destination, you will learn about climate, geology, geomorphology, soils, and flora and fauna as well as the area’s human history and culture, in order to instill a sense of place and to help understand its unique management issues. During three interactive workshops, you’ll learn about environmental psychology, discover how Aboriginal peoples view and relate to their environments, and get practical tools to take effective action toward environmental social change.
Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program highlights and details of coursework, educational excursions, and housing.

# **Alicante, Spain | Liberal Arts in English**
#### **Alicante**
Alicante, often referred to as the jewel of the Costa Blanca, stands out as a captivating harbor city that perfectly balances tranquility and vibrancy. This city is not just a scenic locale with a soothing coastal climate but also a bustling hub of modern Spanish life, pulsating with energy and warmth. **Liberal Arts in English** Designed for students new to Spanish or preferring to study in English, this program at the Universidad de Alicante offers courses in English across various disciplines, alongside Spanish language classes to suit all levels. Guided by a Resident Director, you’ll engage in content-rich courses tailored for international students, complemented by a suite of cultural activities, day trips, and excursions that bring the Spanish culture to life. This immersive experience extends beyond academics, offering a deep dive into Alicante’s rich heritage and daily life, fostering personal growth and a broader global perspective. Through this program, Alicante’s historical streets and vibrant community become your classroom, promising a transformative educational journey. **Program Highlights**
  * Rich Liberal Arts Curriculum: Explore subjects taught in English such as Spanish literature, history, art, sociology, and political science, offering a deep dive into the cultural, social, and historical landscapes of Spain.
  * Optional Spanish Language Courses: Improve your Spanish with courses designed for students at all language levels. 
  * Cultural Immersion: Alicante’s vibrant cultural scene and historical richness serve as an extension of the classroom. Participate in excursions, cultural events, and activities that bring Spanish culture to life.

**Living in Alicante** Living in Alicante means experiencing the warmth of its people, the leisurely pace of life, and the city’s open, welcoming nature. From participating in traditional festivals like the Bonfires of Saint John to enjoying the leisure and sports activities by the sea, life in Alicante is a blend of cultural immersion, educational growth, and unforgettable adventures. **Housing**
  * Homestay: In Alicante, opting for a homestay offers an unparalleled immersion into Spanish life and culture.

Our homestays are carefully selected to ensure a welcoming and conducive atmosphere for learning.

Residence spaces are limited, with priority given to students who have special health and dietary needs. Living in a residence allows you to enjoy a blend of independence and support, with amenities that cater to a student’s lifestyle. While residences provide a unique opportunity to meet students from diverse backgrounds, they also promote a learning environment conducive to academic success. It’s an excellent option for those who prefer a bit more autonomy but still wish to engage closely with the student community in Alicante.

Program Description:
SIT Study Abroad Peru: Indigenous Peoples and Globalization
Explore how indigenous peoples in Peru are adapting and innovating to preserve their cultural values and shape their own future in the face of globalization.
WHY STUDY INDIGENOUS IDENTITIES IN PERU? Up to 45 percent of the population in Peru identifies as members of an indigenous community. Here, you will witness the impacts of globalization on indigenous peoples and be challenged to scrutinize the complexities of identity, transformation, and marginalization. You will have two homestays, one in urban Cuzco and a second on Taquile Island, where you will experience different Peruvian lifestyles, perspectives, and identities.
During three weeks of travel to the Peruvian Amazon and Machu Picchu, and the floating reed islands of the Uros people of Lake Titicaca, you’ll see how communities are working toward their own definition of development and cultural preservation. You will also learn about research methods and ethics, which will prepare you to conduct a month-long Independent Study Project on a topic of your choice related to the program themes.
In addition, you will learn basic Quechua and develop your Spanish language skills related to social and cultural studies through classroom learning, cultural immersion, homestays, and excursions.
Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program highlights and details of coursework, educational excursions, and housing.
MONEY MATTERS
SIT is an all-inclusively priced study abroad program – including academics costs, excursions, accommodations and meals, airport transfers, and health insurance.

Courses are taught in Spanish by distinguished professors, most from one of IES Abroad's partner universities.

Santiago will be your classroom. Imagine practicing your Spanish as you tour local neighborhoods or visit local business organizations as part of your study of Chile's regional and global trade.

SIT Study Abroad Mexico: Migration, Borders, and Transnational Communities
Discover the current realities and human impacts of undocumented migration, border enforcement, and the related international political and social tensions. 
WHY STUDY MIGRATION IN MEXICO? Tensions related to migration through or from Mexico are high and policies change frequently. You’ll start your program in Tucson, Arizona, near a major point of entry into the United States, to learn what undocumented migrants face once on U.S. soil. Then, you will travel to Oaxaca, Mexico, where you will discover how international economics, labor shortages, war, and immigration policy affect migration patterns.
You will also visit Chiapas on the southern Mexican border with Guatemala to hear directly from Central American migrants about challenges they face and see how efforts to restrict human mobility can generate greater levels of vulnerability, including serious human rights abuses. In addition, you’ll learn about transnational communities and the creative ways they support families.
Throughout the program, you will develop the Spanish language skills to discuss and research human rights and social movements issues through classroom learning, cultural immersion, homestays, and excursions.
Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program highlights and details of coursework, educational excursions, and housing.
MONEY MATTERS
SIT is an all-inclusively priced study abroad program – including academics costs, excursions, accommodations and meals, airport transfers, and health insurance.

Program Description:
### Overview
For nearly 50 years, St. Lawrence has operated the Kenya Semester Program, making it one of the longest-running U.S. study abroad programs on the African continent. Based at an SLU-owned and operated campus in a verdant, peaceful, and safe suburb of Nairobi, the Kenya program is rooted in this deep tradition and is committed to providing students with a unique study abroad experience. SLU believes the best way to learn about Kenya is through cultural immersion and experiential learning. As a result, students supplement formal coursework and language study in Kenya's bustling capital city with rural and urban homestays, three additional field components, and a month-long independent study where students examine East Africa's diverse society. As a program that is open to students of all academic interests, SLU welcomes applications from students at other institutions. You can also learn more about the student experience by visiting the Kenya program's Facebook page & Kenya program's blog. Take a virtual tour of the compound and meet the staff or explore a video preview made by KSP alumnus and professional videographer Beau Gaughran '15. 
  * Based in Nairobi
  * Fall or spring semester
  * Enrollment can accommodate up 28 - 30 students (including non-SLU students)
  * Pre-requisites: 2.8 GPA; one African Studies course
  * Must take Swahili while in Kenya
  * Live within program housing and with homestay families
  * State Department Travel Warning and St. Lawrence Policies for Studying Safely in Kenya

If you are NOT a St. Lawrence student and are interested in applying, please contact ciis@stlawu.edu to inquire about non-SLU deadlines and scholarship opportunities. 
### Location
Lying on the Equator, Kenya is home to a diverse population of over 40 million. The cosmopolitan capital city of Nairobi, rising from the plateau of south-central Kenya, is the home base of our program. A city with over three million residents, Nairobi is East Africa's regional center for trade and is one of three cities in the world to host a regional headquarters of the United Nations. Based in this vibrant and diverse city, students will gain familiarity with the urban environment while also visiting many of the rural areas, where approximately 75 percent of the country's population resides. The program's headquarters are located in Karen, a leafy suburb of Nairobi, where St. Lawrence operated a 5 1/2 acre gated campus. Students use the campus as a home base for the semester, but only spend about 8 weeks living here. The two faculty directors, as well as program staff, also live on campus. Students spend time during the semester traveling throughout Kenya and East Africa on various course components explained in detail below. 
### Academics
The Kenya Semester Program is an interdisciplinary academic program that uses a combination of learning models -- classroom, field-based and experiential -- and emphasizes cultural immersion throughout the semester. Students take two required courses. In addition, students select two elective courses so they can focus on their own field of interest or specialization. The program serves majors from a number of different disciplines. Whether matriculated at St. Lawrence or elsewhere, all students must take four courses to earn full-semester credit. For dual-listed courses, students must indicate while registering in Kenya for which department they want the course listed. Therefore, students must confer with their advisors and department chairpersons well in advance of studying in Kenya to plan their program and avoid problems. 
### Housing
The program's headquarters are located in Karen, a suburb of Nairobi, where St. Lawrence University operates a five-acre gated campus. Students use the campus as a home base for the semester but only spend about eight weeks living here. The three program directors, as well as several program staff, also live on campus. Students spend time during the semester traveling throughout Kenya and East Africa on various course components. Students spend the various course components living with homestay families, in hotels, camping for one field component, and in guesthouses or apartments for their independent study.

_SIT Study Abroad/IHP Cities in the 21 st Century: People, Planning, & Politics_
Explore issues of urbanization, and social and spatial justice in four cities within the global economy. Witness how citizens live, work, and organize to advance more just urban environments.
WHY STUDY CITIES IN THE 21ST CENTURY?
Through the prism of social justice, examine how four truly global cities—New York, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, and Cape Town—work and operate within the global economy. This program takes a holistic and interdisciplinary view of academic topics, drawing not only from articles and faculty lectures but also student observations, guest lectures, and the homestay experiences. Meet with thought leaders and academics, public agencies, planners, elected officials, non-governmental organizations, and grassroots groups to see how urban citizens organize to envision, build, and create more just cities. Explore how COVID-19 realities have reshaped urban spaces. Along the way, you will focus on fieldwork methods, practice, and ethics while completing an independent comparative project on a topic of your choice. By immersing yourself in four international cities undergoing rapid change, compare how global politics, economics, local geography, and culture shape social relations in cities across continents, and how each faces its unique challenges.

# **Seville, Spain | Liberal Arts in English**
#### **Seville**
Seville, a beautiful and ancient city on the banks of the Guadalquivir River, is the centerpiece of your study abroad experience. Seville has a temperate climate and rich cultural life. As the land of Carmen and Don Juan, Seville embodies the culture of Southern Spain. In this picturesque city, you will discover Moorish palaces and renaissance gardens, flowered patios, paintings, statues, flamenco dancing and music, bull fights at La Real de Caballería, siesta, tortillas, and the Spanish way of life. **Liberal Arts in English** Explore Liberal Arts in English in the Heart of Seville! Our Liberal Arts in English program in Seville, Spain, offers semester or academic year options for students looking to study a wide range of subjects without the language barrier. Set in one of Spain’s most historic cities, the program combines the richness of Seville’s cultural heritage with an English-taught academic curriculum. **Program Highlights**
  * English-Taught Curriculum: Study subjects like history, sociology, and art, all delivered in English.
  * Cultural Integration: Despite studying in English, you’ll immerse in Spanish culture through activities, excursions, and city exploration.
  * Academic Flexibility: Suitable for students from various disciplines, offering a broad perspective on liberal arts.

Seville’s vibrant atmosphere and rich history provide an inspiring backdrop for students to engage with liberal arts from a global perspective. This program is perfect for those who wish to experience Spain’s cultural wealth while continuing their studies in English. Dive into a unique academic experience in Seville, where you can enjoy the best of both worlds: studying Liberal Arts in English while living in the heart of Spanish culture. **Living in Seville**
  * Language: In Seville, Spanish resonates through the vibrant streets and conversations, offering a chance to immerse yourself in the melodious cadence of Andalusian accents. Participate in language exchanges and engage with locals to fully experience the unique dialect of the region.
  * History: With its rich historical tapestry, Seville bears witness to centuries of influence from Phoenicians, Romans, Moors, and Christians, contributing to its captivating narrative that unfolds in its ancient streets, palaces, and monuments.
  * Architecture: The architectural marvels of the city, epitomized by the stunning Alcázar of Seville and the awe-inspiring Catedral de Sevilla, showcase a blend of Moorish, Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque styles, leaving visitors in awe of the diverse and intricate structures.
  * Art: Seville’s artistic heritage, deeply rooted in the works of painters like Diego Velázquez and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, as well as its vibrant flamenco tradition, brings forth a captivating fusion of visual and performing arts that captivates the soul.
  * Food: The culinary scene of Seville is a delicious journey through Andalusian flavors, with tapas bars offering an array of mouthwatering dishes such as salmorejo, gambas al ajillo, and churros with chocolate, providing a true taste of Spanish gastronomy.
  * Cultural Immersion: To truly immerse oneself in Seville’s culture, one must partake in the lively rhythms of flamenco, savor the local cuisine in bustling markets, and join in the revelry of festivals like Semana Santa and Feria de Abril, where the city comes alive with vibrant traditions and passionate celebrations.

**Housing**
  * Homestay: In Seville, opting for a homestay offers an unparalleled immersion into Spanish life and culture. This choice means you’ll live with a local host family, providing full room and board, including laundry and room-cleaning services. Homestays are ideal for students eager to practice Spanish daily in an authentic setting, enhancing their language skills and cultural understanding. Our homestays are carefully selected to ensure a welcoming and conducive atmosphere for learning. 
  * Student Residence: Student residences offer a more independent living situation while still providing a sense of community with fellow students. Residence spaces are limited, with priority given to students who have special health and dietary needs. Living in a residence allows you to enjoy a blend of independence and support, with amenities that cater to a student’s lifestyle. While residences provide a unique opportunity to meet students from diverse backgrounds, they also promote a learning environment conducive to academic success. It’s an excellent option for those who prefer a bit more autonomy but still wish to engage closely with the student community in Seville.

**Cultural Activities**
  * Welcome to Spanish Flavors: Start your adventure with a friendly welcome dinner, where you’ll savor local dishes like salmorejo and indulge in authentic Spanish tapas, connecting with fellow students and our local team.
  * Historic Neighborhoods: Explore the historic district of Triana, with deep ties to pottery, flamenco, and craftsmanship, cementing its place as the vibrant art scene of Seville.

Program Description:
**SIT India: Public Health, Gender, & Sexuality **
**Understand the pioneering links between public health, gender, and community action in India and Thailand.**
WHY STUDY PUBLIC HEALTH, GENDER, AND SEXUALITY IN INDIA? India has a long and complex history of interventions in reproductive health. Globalization, neoliberalism, and rapid societal changes are changing how India’s public health institutions approach the reproductive health of sexual minorities.
This program offers an opportunity to understand how women and sexual minorities are alternately mainstreamed and marginalized in reproductive and sexual health settings. You will have access to SIT’s longstanding network of institutions and public health officials engaged in national and international decision-making, policy development, and healthcare delivery. During visits with health strategists, experts, and activists, you’ll learn how reproductive epidemiology informs disease management among women and sexual minorities in rural and urban contexts. In rural communities, you will conduct fieldwork and engage with community-based organizations and advocacy groups for a deeper dive into grassroots approaches to healthcare access. Through classroom teaching and immersive field study, you will develop insights into innovations for inclusive and accessible reproductive and sexual health care in one of the most populated democracies in the world. Please visit the SIT Study Abroad website for details on the program highlights and details of coursework, educational excursions, and housing.
MONEY MATTERS
SIT is an all-inclusively priced study abroad program – including academic costs, excursions, accommodations and meals, airport transfers, and health insurance. Be sure to discuss how study abroad costs are handled at your school with your study abroad advisor and read the website for more specific information. 
SCHOLARSHIPS

The city of Berlin has a fascinating geo-political history: its destruction in World War II, its hostile division in the Cold War, the fall of the Wall, the reunification of Germany, and the growth of Germany as a major cultural, economic, and political force in the 21st Century. This history and its present importance make Berlin the ideal place to study International Relations, Security Studies, Sociology, Business, and Economics, as well as Culture, Film, Art, and German Language.

Berlin was once called the heart of Europe, and it remains a significant center of European economic and cultural development. Situated between the East and West, Berlin is a mix of people from different cultures and social systems. People from all over the world have been calling Berlin home for many years. This unique mixture gives the city a kind of rough charm, which is particularly attractive to young people.

## Vienna - Psychology & Social Sciences
#### Program Overview
Vienna is teeming with people from around the world who have made this city their home. Situated at the center of Europe and rich in culture, this is a place where people from all walks of life thrive. Perhaps not surprisingly, it is also a city where the study of society has a long history and where modern psychology claims its birthplace. Many prominent thinkers made Vienna their home—Alfred Adler, Max Wertheimer, Helene Deutsch, Erwin Ringel, Viktor Frankl (who taught at IES Abroad), and, of course, Sigmund Freud. Experience life in Vienna as a student of Psychology and Social Sciences. Our courses give you the opportunity to explore youth cultures, childhood development, virtual identity on the web, the immigrant experience, and the social and psychological dimensions of discrimination. Deepen your learning experience with a program-related trip to destinations throughout Austria, Hungary, and Germany to explore these issues in a broader cultural and geographical context. You can also enroll in an internship or field experience in public service organizations, NGOs, or teaching English to kindergarten, primary, or secondary students. This hands-on experience includes time spent at your placement and an academic seminar that helps you contextualize what you’re learning. If you have sufficient German language skills, you can also enroll in courses at the prestigious Universität Wien. There, you will experience the Austrian education system, be able to participate in University student activities, and make Austrian friends. 
Visit www.IESabroad.org for complete program details.

Housing Options:  |  Residence hall  |  Academic Area:  |  Art History, Classical Studies, Greek, Latin   
Program Description:
The heart of the Centro curriculum is The Ancient City, a double-credit course required of all Centristi. This interdisciplinary class tackles Rome’s art, history, archaeology, topography, social make-up, and much more. The Professor-in-Charge heads up the course, and all Centro faculty lend their expertise to this joint endeavor.
Over the course of a typical week, Centristi dedicate two half-days and one full day to The Ancient City. Almost all class meetings unfold on archaeological sites, in museums, and amid standing remains. Daylong excursions to Rome’s neighboring cities and sites round out the picture of Rome’s growth from a clutch of huts on a hill to the head of a Mediterranean-spanning empire. Additionally, throughout the term, the Centro hits the road for longer excursions: to the Bay of Naples and elsewhere throughout Roman lands, such as Sicily, stunning sites in Northern Italy, colonial cities in Southern France or other spots as chosen by the faculty. Thanks to these trips, The Ancient City touches on Etruscan, Greek, Roman, and native Italian (and even Gallic) populations, their interactions, and mutual influence. While the course focuses on Rome, a rich picture of the city’s broader context emerges as The Ancient City unfolds. What can you expect from The Ancient City? Stand where Cicero delivered speeches in the Forum Romanum. Descend into subterranean shrines to the mystery cult of Mithras. Learn about the self-identities of former enslaved peoples along the Via Appia. Contrast the grand reception rooms of sprawling villas with the cramped kitchens and narrow hallways of urban apartments at Pompeii, Ostia, and Herculaneum.

Program Description:
### Finding solutions to the problems brought about by climate change requires going beyond scientific data. We must also consider the possibilities found within social and political institutions, economic systems, cultural practices, and the creative forces of art, literature, and design. The humanities and social sciences contribute to knowledge of how our changing climate impacts human lives and societies, and they play a vital role in building strategies for global climate resilience and adaptation. During the shore component, students will develop a semester-long research project, review essential climate humanities literature, and design a plan for original field research. Climate & Society will discuss a range of climate related issues including human migration and displacement, coastal and urban resilience, environmental justice, energy alternatives, and sustainable design. The sailing component begins in Auckland, Aotearoa New Zealand, where students will examine climate change issues and local solutions with marine scientists and community leaders. Students will learn about coastal erosion mitigation strategies in Aotearoa New Zealand and explore the effects of climate change on agricultural production and foodways there. Through daily oceanographic surveys, “classroom” discussions, and navigational training while at sea, students participating in Climate & Society will gain a unique and valuable perspective of how climate change links oceanic and terrestrial systems. The Climate & Society cruise track returns to Auckland with a final onboard symposium featuring student presentations of field research and storytelling projects.

Program Description:
Climate change significantly impacts communities residing near and relying on the ocean. Increasingly, residents of vulnerable coastal communities are on the front lines in the struggle against rising seas and strengthening storm cycles. That struggle also raises complex issues of climate justice and public health, everywhere from large urban areas to small rural towns and villages. Climate Change and Coastal Resilience, a mid-level undergraduate program examines the ways climate change is affecting coastal communities and explores strategies for building coastal resilience. Beginning with a shore program in Woods Hole, students gain a theoretical understanding of climate change impacts on societies, ecosystems, and economies. The academic curriculum includes lectures from leading climate scientists and policy experts and field trips to local research institutions in surrounding area. Students engage in discussions on topics such as rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, and ocean acidification. Following the shore program, students embark on a sailing voyage from Auckland to Christchurch, visiting several coastal towns and cities along the way. During their time at sea, students gain hands-on research experience through the deployment of oceanographic research equipment. At port stops, students will connect with local experts and community members to better understand the ways in which climate change is impacting the region.

Program Description:
Healthy coral reefs are vital for thriving and successful island communities, and nowhere is this more evident than in the Caribbean. Historically, coral reefs and their interconnected ecosystems have safeguarded islands, supported growing populations with food, and contributed to tourism and economic growth. However, numerous local and global threats, such as resource extraction, declining water quality, rising temperatures, and reduced pH levels, endanger the Caribbean region, making it one of the most impacted areas worldwide. An investigative science and policy program examining the impacts of human actions on Caribbean coral reef ecosystems, the importance of coral reefs to island communities, and the full range of reef management strategies. Beginning with six weeks in Woods Hole, students develop background knowledge to understand history, science, and policy strategies involved in managing coral reefs. In the eight weeks of the remote shore component, students will engage in coral research in seaside scientific field stations and local communities as they develop and refine reef survey techniques and collect initial observations for comparative reef projects. Students will learn from and assist Caribbean Island partners from local, academic, and governmental agencies in developing or continuing protective measures for the marine environment on and around coral reefs, all while completing their comparative reef projects. Coral Reef Conservation: Caribbean will examine how local, academic, governmental, and international organizations and businesses are working together to conserve and sustainably manage Caribbean coral reef ecosystems.
